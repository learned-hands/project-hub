&amp;nbsp;

It feels as if my landlord is being very intrusive and providing me no privacy.  After ~6 months of minimal communication with my landlord, I receive an email stating that he will be entering at any point for the remaining duration of the lease, to perform ""emergency repairs"" without giving any notice.

&amp;nbsp;

I responded that I would like ~24 hour notice before he plans to enter, but he disregarded that.  He claims this is allowed, as the lease states ""he or authorized personnel have the right to enter to make normal repairs, improvements, do code work, do maintenance work, or do other construction without prior notice.""

&amp;nbsp;

I have been trying to locate applicable laws, and the closest I have found is New York Real Property Law § 235, but I am unsure of how well they apply to the situation.  For example, § 235-d (1) seemed to be relevant, but it begins with ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within a city having a population of one million or more ...""  However, my city is located in upstate New York, and has a population of roughly 30,000.

&amp;nbsp;

I suppose my two main questions are:

* Given the lease clause, is my landlord actually allowed to enter at any point in time, for any reason, without proper notice?

* If so, what is the suggested course of action if he does enter under those circumstances?  Contact local police?

I've contacted former landlords to get their opinion but I'd like to hear as many as possible. First off, the proprietors of the building are pretty much unreachable. It's owned by the legal group representing a family that lives in Toronto. The address associated with the proprietor is an apartment in the building and no phone or email is listed.

Now for the issues;
-though not illegal the concierge makes me feel very uncomfortable by calling me petnames, doing bisous or touching my shoulders and arms whenever talking to me-all things I feel are inappropriate for a relationship that is purely professional. 
-he usually smokes in his apartment or outside the building but on a few occasions I have found him smoking in the hallways as he goes around the building which he is not allowed to do since the hallways are common areas
-he refuses the tenants to have guests, he yelled at my roommate as she and her boyfriend we taking his suitcase up to our apartment where he was invited to stay for the week between the end of his lease and his flight back home. He also yelled at me and my friend and blocked the front door in order to keep my friend from staying the weekend in my apartment saying I didn't have the right to have more than 3 people sleeping in the apartment at any time and if I wanted to have a guest stay the night I needed to file an application with him. 

I asked him if we could go over the lease so he could explain to me what part of it provided him the authority to require applications and refuse invited guests of tenants since I know that he has neither of those authorities. It's not listed in the basic lease we all sign and he didn't add it to the section where he listed any other rules regarding the apartment-he even made the error of saying the apartment may have 4 people in it though it's a 5 1/2 and signed by three people.

I'm worried filing a complaint with the régie will take too long especially since I've invited my brother to stay with me for a couple of days at the end of the month.

Seven years ago my then-wife and I bought a condo. It was put in her name but everything including the down payment was split down the middle. We divorced four years later in July 2015 (without lawyers) and we agreed that I would continue living there since she could move in with her mom rent-free. The divorce decree said I would continue paying half the mortgage until it sold and at that point we'd split the money we made (if any). I wanted to cut my losses and walk away since the condo isn't tied to me at all, but she refused to sign the papers unless I agreed to continue paying half the mortgage until it sold.

She said it'd go on the market as soon as it was show-ready. I gave it a good cleaning and bought some nice decorations and new couches for staging. it looked better than when we bought it. She said then it'd go on the market in the spring because that's when most people look for new homes. That never happened. A year ago we agreed that my new girlfriend could move in and take over paying half the mortgage until it sold. So, at that point my ex wasn't paying anything except property tax. After several months it still wasn't on the market. I told her it needed to be put on the market and sold ASAP so we both could move on with our lives. She said she met with a real estate agent friend and the condo is now worth a hell of a lot less than what we paid for it. She said we'd have to keep paying the mortgage for 3 more years until we sell it to break even.

This is unacceptable. It's been 2 years since the divorce and we've made no progress. I desperately want to move and be done with my ex once and for all, but because of our divorce agreement I feel stuck. Moving and taking on a second mortgage/rent is not a possibility -- I barely make enough to cover my bills as it is.

I'm planning on meeting with a lawyer soon to see what my options are, if I even have any. Before I do that, I'd like to hear what /r/legaladvice has to say. Would it be possible to take her back to court and have the divorce agreement revised? I want nothing more than to walk away from this damn condo and create a new life with my girlfriend.

5b60e59cda52255c20cff91a,"Can I get my pet back? [NJ]. Hello

I live with my bf and i had a pet (dog/cat, rather not say which) for 2 years before we moved in together. Once we moved in he expressed hatred for my pet. He was willing to deal with it, it seemed. But we got into multiple fights daily because of the pet's behavior. I mentioned once in passing that I feel I might have to give the pet away (this was in no way shape or form permission for him to give away my pet, just a passing thought because of our fighting). But he said, no don't do that. 

One day I go to work and I come home to no pet. He decided to give it to a coworker without my permission or knowledge. Once I expressed to him how upset this made me, he promised to get it back. Well the coworker gave the pet to someone else as a gift, but was willing to work with us. He approached the person he gave the gift to.

Gift receiver said no initially. So we offered money. Person later felt bad when they found out the pet was not a random animal but in fact had a previous owner and was given away without permission(they had no idea the pet was not a stray when they received it as a gift). But would only return animal if money was offered to recoup for expenses ($200). We paid money happily. 

Gift receiver starts giving us the runaround at this point. Keeps promising to return pet if we met at their house, but refused to meet anywhere else. The whole thing was shady and weird but I was desperate. When we arrived at the residence the new owner said hang tight while I find the pet. Never came back to the door. After almost an hour we knock again and they tell bf to come inside. I'm not sure what happened at this point but there was some sort of altercation and pet was never returned. We left. Situation was sketchy and we were worried about our safety. 

My question is, what can we do at this point? This person has agreed to return the pet, with no problem, but now it has been a few months since we initially started going back and forth with these people. I understand the pet was given away but the pet did not belong to the person who gave them away in the first place. And what's more, we paid this person money and now we feel left high and dry. Aside from the situation i have to deal with inside of my relationship because my significant other thought it was okay to give away my beloved pet, what else can i do to deal with new owner?

TL; DR:

Boyfriend gave my pet away without my permission. Person in turn gave pet to someone else as a gift. New owner thought gift was a stray, was not aware it had a previous owner. We offered money in exchange for pet. New owner insisted we meet at their house to pick it up (this was weeks after we paid $200 to them). Upon arrival at new owners house we were met with confrontation and never received my pet. What else can I do?",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,,,0.25,,0.25

I had a baby three weeks ago, and we found out that there is something in our apartment that makes it hard for him to breathe. We tried everything: cleaning, laundry, air purifiers, humidifiers, etc. think it's smoke from another apartment, but don't know how to prove it. My husband and I have been staying with the baby at my parents' house for a few days, and he hasn't had any trouble breathing. We took him back to the apartment for a few hours last night, and he started to have trouble breathing again. Whatever is bothering him, it was on all of the clothes we brought back with us until we washed them. 

Would it be possible to break our lease without penalty, if we can't live there? We need to find somewhere else to live, but that's not an option if we're stuck paying for this apartment. Our lease isn't up until December, and I can't seem to find anything definitive about options for breaking it. It looks like the management needs to make a good effort to lease out the apartment, if we say we don't want to stay, but I don't know how that will work out.

We had several improvements done to our front yard about one year ago (new walkway, new sprinkler system, planting, etc).  The general contractor we hired subcontracted out the concrete work.  After all the work was completed, we paid the contractor the final installment (50% was due before the job started, 50% due after).  Total job was ~$8,500.

Now, a year later, the subcontractor drives by my house on a Saturday and lets me know he hasn't been paid.  This is certainly news to me!  He has been stiffed by the general contractor and says he will try to come after me.  He then showed me the invoice for concrete work that was supposedly unpaid by the contractor (nearly $2000). He said he sent me a notice in the mail ""a month ago"" that he was going to file a mechanics lien and wanted to know if I got that notice.  I never received that notice.  At this point, my Saturday morning chores are pretty much the last thing on my mind and I am very concerned.

After 20 minutes of reading articles (from a google search), it seems like contractors and subcontractors have 90 days to file a mechanics lien.  It also says that they must file a notice to the property owner before filing the mechanics lien.

What do I do?  I have no evidence that the contractor didn't pay the subcontractor.  The contractor could very well have paid the subcontractor and I would never know!  Seems fishy, it almost seems like the subcontractor is trying to collect twice.  Since we are way beyond 90 days here, is this even something I should worry about?  What happens if I never got the notice he said he sent and he still filed a lien somehow?

5b60e59cda52255c20cff96f,"(PA) Is it or is it not legal to dock pay as a punitive measure?. A conversation with one of the owners of my company has me wondering.  He is advocating for docking pay for mistakes.  His example was to dock an hour of pay even if the mistake took the employee only 5 minutes to correct.  His reasoning is that docking only 5 minutes of pay would not hurt the employee enough to not make the mistake again.  His intention is to punish not to recover actual costs.

This is also a job with a lot of judgement required and grey areas.  Therefore, this would be a matter of him deciding after the fact that performance or the outcome was not sufficient. 

The employees make over minimum wage and are part time hourly employees.  In researching this, I found conflicting information.  The law says that hourly employees must be paid for all hours worked.  It also says that pay can be docked as long as overall compensation does not drop below minimum wage.

Before anyone says it, yes, I am looking for a new job.

1. Can he deduct pay, by the hour, as a punishment?
2. Would it make it legal if he made it a set dollar amount, like a fine, as long as it does not drop below minimum wage?
3.  If he could reason that the company lost X dollars due to the mistake, would that give him legal rights to dock pay?

The corporation is filed as a 501c3 which I know because I looked it up and found the paperwork, however, they publicly announce themselves as a non-profit under 501c7 status which is untrue. Their ""Organization"" is an artist collective/fan club for a TV show which benefits absolutely no charity nor is it fitting under the definition of a 501c3 non-profit. 

Their ""main event"" isn't a fundraiser it's basically a convention where they have some how hired celebrities to appear to do photo ops and autographs but once again if they do profit from this (and by current figures they most likely won't) they still have no charity indicated as a beneficiary and refuse to address why they are listed as a 501c3 instead of a 501c7 as they claim

We killed the bat and brought it in to the U of M emergency veterinary services for testing to see if it had rabies. We also brought both of our cats in to a vet to get rabies boosters this morning to further ensure they don't get the disease. We haven't heard back from the U of M yet, but I'm wondering if our landlord can be held responsible for any of the fees since it is either their fault for the bat getting into our apparent through a crack in our walls, or it got into our apartment because they leave both of the front doors and all of the fire doors open at night causing the bat to get into the building,and then sneak through our front door. We asked our maintenance guy about the situation and he said this was the second incident this month and they are calling an exterminator next week. Apparently this has been an on going problem and no one has told us. We're going in on Monday to see if the landlord will cover at least part of the vet bill. Do they have any responsibility to cover the bill legally or are we just stuck with the bill if they refuse? The initial bill for the booster shots plus all of their extra fees was $250 or so, but this will get much more expensive if the test for the bat comes back positive for the rabies virus, especially since we suspect that it was in our house overnight while we were sleeping so then we will need to get treatment.

5b60e59cda52255c20cffa58,"[Ontario] Water softener rental with house purchase. So I bought my house around 5 years ago and when I bought it, it came with a water softener.  Unknown to me, the softener was a rental.

Fast forward 5 years, the previous owner of the house has now passed away and the estate has noticed that she had been paying for the rental for the last 5 years, which came to around $1500.  My real estate agent contacted me and told me that the estate would probably be contacting me, which they did through a letter.  In the letter they didn't ask for the $1500 but they did ask me to contact the rental company to assume the rental. 

I contacted the rental company and they wanted me to assume control of the contact, which I have never seen. I obviously would rather not since after talking to them, paying for this rental is $25/month and the agreement goes on for another 10 years or so.  I'll end up paying $3000 myself on top of the $1500 that the estate already paid for a water softener that's worth $2000.  Buying it out is going to cost me $800 and it's already a 7 year old unit.  

I found a contract from the same company that that has this verbiage about transferring the agreement, although I have no idea if it is the same as the contract that was actually signed by the previous owner.
&gt; Transferring This Agreement: If you are the Owner and you sell or otherwise transfer the Premises, you are required to inform the transferee, at or before the effective date of the sale or transfer, of the existence of this Agreement and the rental Equipment installed in the Premises. We will permit the purchaser to assume your rights and obligations under this Agreement, effective from the date of sale, or other transfer, provided that (i) you or your representative notify the transferee in the sale or transfer agreement that the Equipment is rented and is subject to this Agreement, (ii) you or your representative advise us in advance of the transferee’s name and the intended date of sale or other transfer, (iii) you or your representative advise us in advance of the address and telephone number where you can be contacted after the date of sale or transfer, (iv) the transferee agrees to assume your obligations, and (v) you have paid us all amounts owing under this Agreement. Unless and until these conditions are satisfied, or unless we otherwise waive any or all of these conditions, which we are under no obligation to do, you will remain responsible (individually or jointly and severally with the Lessee, as applicable) for the Equipment rental and your obligations under this Agreement, including making all rental payments. You hereby authorize us to respond to information requests relating to your account made by or on behalf of the transferee. We may (but are not required to) accept performance of your obligations (including payment obligations) from other parties (such as tenants).

My houses purchase agreement states that I would assume control of any rentals but neither real estate agent or lawyer seemed to have followed up on this or made the transfer.  My real estate agent is pretty adamant that this is a rent-to-own and not a rental and not explicitly stated in the purchase agreement.   

So, I'm not too sure what to do.  Try to push this back on the estate and tell them they didn't follow through with the agreement?  Bite the bullet and assume the rental until I can get out of it?

First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.

Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al’s devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.


Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?


What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?


Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?


Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.

My husband has two sons from a previous relationship (not marriage). The older one lives with us and the younger one lives with their mom. This was her choice. Before my husband and I got together she decided she no longer wanted the older boy to live with her, she gave no reason why. My husband told her that he wanted both but she would only give him the older boy.

She makes no effort to visit with the older boy. She'll call him and tell him how much she loves and misses him and promise that he can come spend the night at her house soon, which never happens. She just gets his hopes up then crushes him. I really want to adopt him, but I don't know how to do that. If his mom has to sign some sort of document, it won't happen. She cares about her image too much. She's always posting pictures of him on facebook (pictures that my husband and I take, she takes them from our profile) and saying how much she loves him. She just does it so her facebook friends will praise her on what a good mom she is. I really don't think she cares about him at all. 

My husband and I regularly pick up the younger boy and he stays at our house for a few days. Whenever we go to pick up the younger boy, the mom gives the older boy a quick hug and maybe a cheap toy that breaks in an hour, and sends us on our way. Also, the younger boy is absolutely filthy every single time we pick him up. He stinks of urine and feces, and his skin and hair is always sticky. His teeth are yellow so I don't think she ever brushes them. (Side note, the older boy only has 7 teeth because she neglected to brush them and they all rotted out, and she always had him sleep with a bottle of formula). He has horrible manners, he hits and bites everyone. Her home is full of cats and dogs and the entire house just smells like urine. She lives with her boyfriend, her mom, and her two brothers. One of her brothers has cerebral palsy and no one takes care of him. He always stinks because no one bothers to change his diaper. They lock him in his room where he soils himself all day and they all ignore him. Once she called my husband in a panic because her boyfriend hit the child brutally, then later said it was nothing and he's fine and its none of my husband's business. She is still dating that same guy. My husband desperately wants to get him out of there but he doesn't know where to start, because she won't willingly give him up like she did her other son.

5b60e59cda52255c20cffae5,"My parents signed a 5-year loan payment that they can not get out of. Now the business seems to be closed and their account is still being charged.. Alberta, Canada.

Back in September 2014, my mom got a call from this company that wanted to introduce an online tutoring service. My mom was interested so she invited them to our home. My parents spoke to the sales lady for about four hours and signed contracts with them that same day.

One month after using it, my siblings and I found the program really generic and unhelpful so we asked our parents to cancel it. A sales person came to our home again to ask us about our problems with their services. They only called back to say that there is no possible way to cancel it.

In the contract that my parents signed for the buyers right to cancel, it specifically says: ""If you do not receive the goods or services within 30 days of the date stated in the contract, you may cancel this contract within one year of the contract date. You lose that right if you accept the delivery after 30 days. There are other grounds for extended cancellation.""

The issue:

This part is important!!! In the contract to pay each monthly Loan payment of $183 for a term of 60 months it says: *""We are aware that other than the cancellation rights contained in the Notice of Buyers Right to Cancel, which are outlined on the Purchase Order, we cannot cancel the purchase and/or the Loan.* I also acknowledge and agree that no representative of __company name___ has promised or represented to us that we may cancel the Purchase and/or the Loan."" (they signed this the same day as the buyers right to cancel contract). 

To be sure, does that mean my parents signed a contract making them unable to terminate the contract? It sounds like my parents are surely bound to this for two more years, but still, I want to ask because I want to be hopeful, is there any way to cancel this? In the end, it's going to be a financial loss of almost 11 thousand dollars...

Everything is going fine (I check up on his progress weekly) and he is repairing minor problems like repainting the walls and clearing debris until he contacts me telling me there was a problem with a pipe in the bathroom and water flooded the surrounding area. He insists that he never actually went into the bathroom and the flooding is a problem I never notified him about. I insist that he has been to the bathroom and inspected it before and he denies (even though my realtor confirms that the contractor inspected the bathroom multiple times before with the realtor present). He then storms out without issuing a refund for work he has not completed (paid in advance) and he has not returned the key I gave him. 

Furthermore, he did a terrible paint job (didn't use primer so the walls are chipping apart or a cover sheet for the wooden floors so now the wood is stained with paint). 

We have contacted Home Advisor but they insist because he has at least a 3 star rating they cannot remove him from their website.

5b60e59cda52255c20cffb32,"Neighbor is harassing us, can we get out of the lease? [long post](California). I'm currently in a 1 year lease for an apartment.
It's a multi dwelling apartment, meaning that we have separate entrances, and separate driveways.

However we have an upstairs neighbor, and she has been very nasty to us.

We started to get weird vibes from her from the beginning, like she is nice to us, but only when other people are around. (Like the landlord, her neighbors, or sometimes her friends.)
But when see her and no one else is around, she is cold and curt. Sometimes she would just ignore us.

For example, when we moved in the landlord said to work out parking spots with her. There is our driveway (which is insanely steep), and then a little 2 car lot at street level which is her driveway (she only has 1 car). you can also fit a car parallel to the road next to a power line pole. She said ""yeah it's really whatever, first come first serve. We just kind of figure it out. It's not assigned parking spots"" seemed pretty chill.

Actually on the night before we toured the unit before we knew that we had it, someone had ran into her car which damaged her parking so only 1 car fits there until they fix it, so she got the OK from the neighbor across the street (super kind and generous man.) to park in his dirt lot which can hold like 6-8 cars.

an example of weird vibes is that, before we had finished moving in, my father in law and I were bringing a couch I had bought, we didn't cover it and it started raining right as we got into town. We parked in one of the spots that was supposedly cool to park in, but she got home shortly after and was very impatient with us and was really demanding, asking us how long we are gonna be there cause she has a friend coming over (meanwhile it's raining and the couch I bought is getting wet). so I asked if we should park in the dirt lot, and she loudly said ""NO"".

she had the unit to herself for a few months before we signed our lease, so we are thinking she got used to how things were?

She sent us texts at 4:30pm when we were moving in saying that we were being too loud, and we apologized and explained why the sound was happening to which she replied ""great""

She send us another text, at about 9:40pm on a Saturday night, asking ""do you have carpets yet? maybe that would help..."" this was during my 'bachelor party' (I just had some friends over to play video games before I got married)

Since then she has had many parties (outside on her deck) that go late (11:00pm, 12:00am, 1:00am) on a weeknight, at one point she had a party go until 2:45am on a Friday night, with loud music, stomping (not walking, stomping), and when my wife and I woke up we noticed there were cigarette butts on our deck.. our deck that's covered in dry leaves.

Anyways.. a week or 2 after that, we were almost done unpacking. We had been given a piece of furniture by my sister and we decided to get rid of it by putting it in our driveway (not in the street) with a free sign on it.

we had seen the other neighbors leave stuff out with free signs, like a couch, an aquarium, and a cat jungle gym. There is no HOA here either.

She texted us about it, at which point we texted the landlord asking if what we did was ok, he said it was fine.
So we replied, and explained that we saw the other neighbors do it, and that the landlord said it was ok. but we apologized that it was bothering her and that we would move it when we got home (we were out at dinner).

She replies with a lot of condescension and sarcasm, and claims that she has never seen anyone put furniture out on our street, and that she would never do that ""that's what the dump is for"" and that we need to remember that she lives here too, and that her associates come over.

we decided not to respond to that because it was obviously a lost cause (we suspect she had been drinking because there were a lot of typos). When we got home, the Futon was gone. we thought someone had taken it (it was dark), but when we walked down our driveway we saw that she (presumably) had dragged/pushed it down the driveway. We can't prove it was her. but it would make sense.

there was a huge scrape mark going down the length of the driveway, and the leg of the furniture was bent from being dragged.

we felt like that was an invasion, we didn't feel safe. It was a totally aggressive and dramatic move. not to mention completely unnecessary because we said we would move it. At that point we contacted our landlord to let him know what happened. he said he was unsure of what to do, if he should call her, or wait until his next time coming down (some contractors had done repairs) which he said would be ""in the coming weeks""

we said we would prefer it if he came down so the 4 of us could talk. we didn't want him to call her, because she could just make stuff up. also because she isn't nasty when he's around, we felt like it would help us all reach a amicable solution if he was there as an arbiter.

he said he would come down, but that was more than a month ago.

One night when we were showering, we heard really loud and startling stomping above our heads. We finished our shower and when we got out of the shower we saw that our neighbor had texted my wife using all caps, asking if we just started a load of laundry at 12:00am. - when we do something she doesn't like, she ramps up to 60mph at the drop of a hat, and does something physical.

Based on earlier events, we didn't reply to this text at all. But I emailed my landlord about it.

I didn't feel like we owed it to her to respond to her abusive texts if she's going to be rude and aggressive. and as the days went by we kept showering whenever we wanted to.

She stomped a few more times (at one point even doing like 'marching band' stomping.. it's hard to explain, but doing it with both feet very fast and very loud)

 and at one point she texted my wife again and said that ""she had a meeting early the next morning and our late laundry is disturbing her sleep""

So I (hesitantly) replied on my phone that ""Hello &lt;neighbor&gt;. We actually haven't ever done laundry past 9:00pm, what you're hearing is our shower""

She was sarcastic in her response.. ""so? whatever it is is keeping me up at a very late hour""

This was kind of annoying to us, because she has people over stomping right above our heads several times a month late into the night, and after they leave she is cleaning up moving furniture around slamming it down on her deck.

I've been emailing all of this as it develops to my landlord, he was surprised at her response and expected her to be more laid back (don't really know why.. considering the furniture incident). My landlord said, if she complains again, just tell her that we hear her when her friends are over and lived with it.

A few days later we had to contact him again because our dryer had gone out and we were working on replacing it. He actually said our neighbors dryer went out too (and she left it on the hill outside of our bathroom window...) which angered me because she was harassing us about our furniture but she leaves her dryer outside of our window? I moved it a few feet over because I didn't want to see it, and I didn't want to contact her about it. (then the next day she left a cardboard box to a new samsung phone in the same exact spot...)

He said he has been busy with work and unable to come down, but in the meantime, if we see her, if we bump in to her, then should try to talk to her for a few minutes and just say ""look , we want to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers, but when you have friends over late we hear that too and lived with it."". He has been sympathetic to us, but hasn't actually done anything yet. He said that if she is disrespectful again, then he will call her himself, he also said if it was him, he wouldn't want to live here either.

Since her text we had tried to get our showers done earlier (before 11:00pm). Some of the times she has stomped it was when she was clearly awake. We will drive up to our house and see her flipping channels on her TV, we can hear her walking around, calling her cat inside, and on the phone etc... But as soon as we get in the shower she starts stomping. and complains that we are 'waking her up'

So just last week my wife and I shower at 10:30pm, and we hear her start stomping around above us.. I didn't know what to do, so my wife and I wrote a text on my phone but didn't send it, we wanted to sit on it.

We decided, if we saw her the next day, we would try talking to her. But if we didn't we would text her. I felt like I should text her soon because my family was coming over for the long 4th of July weekend, and I didn't want her to be stomping if they needed to shower. (we had a beach day + dinner planned, so I knew we were gonna get back late)

Well we didn't see her, so I texted her Monday July 3rd while we were at dinner saying:

""Good evening neighbour.

I was wondering if you were stomping again during our shower last night? I guess even if you weren't, I wanted to say some things and try to clear the air.

We want to be able to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers.
But here's the thing.... when you have your friends over with music playing late at night during the week, we hear that. and we've lived with it.
In May you had people over until almost 3am with really loud stomping and music right above our heads as we were trying to sleep.
I've even heard you take a hammer to your floor at 11:00pm
You woke us up this morning at ~7:40am. with your banging furniture around on your deck right above our bedroom.

Because we live under you, we hear a lot more than you might realize, but we've lived with it.

Live and let live, that's what we've been trying to do.

We've been accommodating and respectful to you. That's all we are asking in return.""

to which she replied:

""I think u need to learn how to live with neighbors.. have you ever lived in a multiple dwelling place before?  There is etiquette involved...and waking people up late (10pm-6am)cause thats when u decided to take a shower is not cool. 

 Having friends over...talking...listening to music at a reasonable hour is cool.  

Leaving your trash / used furniture out on the side of the road with a Free sign on it like you just moved into the ghetto is not cool.

Having friends over ONCE in 3 months late on a Friday night is cool.  

Not communicating concerns you have to your neighbor and instead hitting them with an Uber long text on a monday night....not cool

Having 3 gorgeous decks and wanting to sit outside at 8am is absolutely ok.  It is not my fault you choose to keep non-business hours.
Stop taking showers late (after 10pm) and everything will be okay on my end.  

If my friends stay past 10pm on a weeknight and we are loud...absolutely let me know and we will move it inside.

But if I have friends over 2-3 times a year...late on a Friday or Saturday night....suck it  buttercup.  

 You may want to have people over too...and you know what...i won't say anything 2-3 times a year
And no....you haven't been accommodating and respectful....you have been disdainful and rude.  You didn't even acknowledge me outside one day.. walked right past me.....i smiled said hi....u were completely disrespectful and rude.
I think I have addressed all your concerns.  Have a good night""

After she sent that, I emailed my landlord again.

He replied July 4th in the morning and he said he was frustrated and didn't know what to do. In the 12 years he's owned the place he's never had this problem. He said if we wanted him to, he could call her.

We spent 2 nights at my in laws because being home was too stressful at this point. We were sacred of how she would react when he called her, and we were scared to go home. Even taking a shower at my in laws was stressful. My wife has severe anxiety, and to be honest this situation is giving me a lot of anxiety too.

I emailed my landlord on the 5th, asking if he had called her yet. and he said he hasn't called her because he wanted to enjoy the holiday without any drama.

I haven't heard anything from him since then.

However since then I've looking into taking legal action (trying to get a free consultation from a lawyer here).
I don't know what the landlord is going to do, if anything. or if talking to her is going to help anything at all (or make it worse).

When she dragged our futon around, was that vandalism? Should we have called the police? is it too late to call now?

Is what she's doing defined as harassment? Is that enough for us to get out of a lease? Is there any other legal action we can take?

We are scared to bump into her.. and she is always on her wrap around deck above us which means if we use our deck we would have to see her.

Rent isn't cheap in California, and if my landlord isn't gonna do anything I don't see why I need to pay thousands more dollars to be living under a bully with this stress. We have family willing to take us in until we find a new place.

We are very skeptical that he will evict her.",0.75,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,0.25

I want to make a video in which I argue that, *hypothetically speaking*, a violent revolution would be ethical. I don't want to go too much into the details of the argument, but the basic idea is that a violent revolution against a certain industry/practice (not the government per se) would be ethical because that industry/practice causes more harm and suffering than would be entailed in the revolution. In essence, my argument is that it would be ethical to resort to violence in this case because violence is already being done and the net effect of this revolution would be a decrease in violence. The primary example I use is that of abolitionist John Brown, whose violent revolution (though unsuccessful) many credit with setting off the chain of events that led to the American Civil War and thus the abolition of human slavery.

In the beginning of the video I plan to explicitly state that this is purely hypothetical and that I do not intend to commit any violence myself and I am not suggesting anyone else do the same.

Philosophers talk about this kind of stuff all the time. For example, Sam Harris has said that it's perfectly normal in a philosophy seminar to talk about whether it's ethical to kill and eat human babies, though no one actually has any intention of doing that.

My girlfriend is currently renting an apartment with her friend and their refrigerator has stopped working properly. The freezer is broken and neither of the fridge or freezer is working properly. E.g. freezer is leaking and the fridge is warmer than normal. 

Now, this is the first I have heard of it and am trying to get her to scan me her rental agreement, but she is positive they cover the appliances. According to her, and with information to back this up:

* She has talked and emailed her landlord approximately 5 times now over the course of at least 30 days and he keeps saying its on order or that they need measurements again to order the unit. This has gone on several times.

* Since this has happened her power bill has doubled, obviously from the unit working 24/7 because it cannot satisfy the temperature and they have actually decreased the time that they use their AC to almost half. Yet the bill still went from $80 to ~$170.

Another issue they have received is a letter attached to their door stating that:

&gt;  ""Please note that we have sent your lease to our attorney to file suit with the district court of Maryland for non-payment of rent and requested possession of your apartment home.""

Again, according to her:

* They have documentation of payment in the form of a receipt and the signature of the person that they have always paid. Which he has stated numerous times that they pay around a week early. Now, this she has stated, is not the normal way they receive a receipt, but both checks are photocopied front and back with a signature of their lease manager (I assume this is his title, as he is the one that directly handles the money and tenant problems but he is not the landlord). The amount on the paper is also not the amount that they pay in rent per month. We assume a mistake in their billing dept. Also, this letter was not signed.

Steps I have told her to take:

1. Send a certified letter of previous interactions of the request of the replacement/fixing of the fridge.
2. Set up a meeting as soon as possible to clear up the rent payment mistake. Wonder if it is the fact that the receipt was improperly recorded.

Other than that my big questions are, because I am not from MD and neither is she, what type of recourse do we have for the:

* Electric bill compensation
* Fridge being basically defunct for a month
* Possibility of them not accepting the receipt

I could not get a straight answer on this from Googling, and I believe it's illegal for me to not stay if the next person does not show up.

There was a surge of wastewater while they had the line blocked(my vague understanding of the situation) and it caused the waste to back up into my house, completely covering the downstairs floor in sludge that I assume to be mostly human waste.  I woke up sometime within the next 3 hours to find this;  went outside and got ahold of the sewage company workers who were still working outside and let them know about it, they contacted their supervisor who came to my house, took pictures, called his boss and then told me that they were taking responsibility for the  incident.

They've also agreed to get the HVAC ducts cleaned out because the AC is currently circulating the smell of sewage through the house even after the cleanup downstairs.

5b60e59cda52255c20cffcea,"(NY) Do I have a legal obligation to report this person for inappropriate relationships with minors/students?. This happened before states began to outlaw student teacher relationships even if the student was over the age of consent.

Essentially, when I was going through a rough time emotionally, I began receiving a lot of extra attention from a teacher. It started innocently and then progressed to emails, followed my phone calls, then texts, then flirting, some sexting and sending him pictures of me in skimpy negligees. When I graduated high school (he was still my teacher for a summer session) we began to go out on dates. He then came to my college to take control of the department I was majoring in and remained my teacher throughout college (we maintained a relationship during this time). 

Now with all of the new legislation and scandals being unearthed (like the choate one) I'm wondering if I have an obligation to report this to someone (the school, his current employer which still has him around students all the time etc). I don't want to get him in trouble because I do still care about him and as far as I'm aware he didn't break any laws (except possession of child porn when I sent the negligee pics (if they count) but they are long gone from all of my electronic devices (this was before the cloud etc). 

See the thing is, I don't know if what he did was wrong/ illegal. My therapist (when I was 17 and involved with him) told me to cut ties but never reported him. My guidance counselor at school knew because the man in question didn't have a drivers license so I drove him one on one to the practice he had at another school after ours was over and I once told my guidance counselor I may be late because of driving him and she said it was inappropriate but never followed up. I don't like thinking I was groomed or a victim (though he was emotionally abusive once he had me in the relationship). 

I also have proof/know he did this with at least four other students.

So, if it happens in the future and I don't report it am I liable for what happens to any further students he becomes involved with? 

Do I have a legal obligation to report it to the schools he works for?

I need to know if there's anything I need (or should) do from a legal standpoint.

 I don't want to press charges (I can't he did nothing illegal with me) and I don't want to get him in trouble but I also don't want any other students to go through what I did and I what I know others did because of his narcissism (he's diagnosed) and emotional abuse.

I can't take this anymore. I want to leave this house and be my own person. I am tired of being threatened to leave by my parents. I do so much for them and they hate me.

I am 20 years old, unemployed, and have no car or drivers license. I was adopted unofficially and have no legal paperwork and have no idea if I even have a SSN or any means to get legal help in my situation. For all my life I have been treated as a glorified slave and nanny. I have pretty much raised all 3 of my younger siblings because my parents always had to work (which I understand) but it's way past the normal help here and there. I watched them as babies and fed and bathed them, I took them to school and all of that since I was 8 or so. For 20 years I have been the backbone of my family.

Although I didn't provide financial help I did do pretty much every thing else even cooking and cleaning after my siblings parents and grandparents. They don't even seem to realize how unhappy I am. I asked my parents for my information so I could get a job and they don't have it, they  flat out refused for 20 years to help me change that. Since  I graduated HS in 2015 they've been telling me to leave the house and to get a job but I simply can't because they all ask for my ID and what not and I don't have it. I hate not having my own identity to prove who I am to future employers. I want a change and I am totally helpless and powerless. I have no control over my life and it's already taken a toll on my mental health. I need an escape badly. 

I've attempted suicide more than 5 times from 13-20 years of age and I always change my mind because these people are not worth my life. Yes they did raise me but it feels like they only did so, so they could keep me as free labor. I'm basically just a tool to them they don't even let me stay over family members houses or go out simply because they want me to watch the kids so THEY can go out or sleep or whatever. It's so maddening and I do it only because I love my siblings they need me and I need them especially the youngest one, she loves me more than our parents or anyone combined and I can't bare to leave her with them. 

 I'm so conflicted because they do this to me but on the other hand when we go out together and do family things I feel loved. But the good is only about 10% while the other 90% makes it not worth it in the long run.

5b60e59cda52255c20cffd90,"My Landlord is making changes to our building/street for the worse, is there anywhere I can report him?. Hi everyone! This story takes place in Los Angeles, CA.

To spare you some reading time, I'll present some bullet-points about my landlord to give you all an idea of who I am dealing with: 

- Lost in court against my former neighbors after it was found that he was illegally raising their rent. Was forced to pay over $5,000.

- Berated another tenant for not paying him on the 1st of the month (even though she left her check in the dropbox at 10pm on the 1st) and insulted her special needs son.

- Attempted to evict another tenant and gave her 14 days to leave the premises under threat of keeping the entirety of her security deposit. She ended up calling the Sheriff and was able to remain in the building...she still left as soon as she could.

- Complained to tenants about all of the legal fees he's accrued and why this caused him to raise costs in our Laundry Room. 

- Took out the grass in the front of the building and paved it over to create a parking spot without any notice of the intensive construction to tenants. We had to use milk crates as steps during this time and dirt was caked over anything that was left outside the building...our cars in the carport included.

Now, my question is related to the last issue. The area in which he created the driveway to the new parking spot is next to a street sweeping sign put in place by the city. Today, I was awakened by the sound of a saw and, when I looked out over my balcony, I saw my landlord removing the street sweeping sign. He quickly replaced it with two new signs: one that states ""Active Driveway: Tow-Away Zone"" and another that says ""No Parking Anytime"".

Now, I get that he's got a right to create this driveway, however, he placed the sign in front of a perfectly good parking space. As some of you might not know, street parking in Los Angeles is hard to come by and finding parking on our street is damn near impossible. My roommates and I only get two parking spaces for our 3 Bedroom apartment so we utilized this space often, usually the moment it opened up after street sweeping.

So, can I report him removing the street sweeping sign? I also don't think he got a permit for the construction of the driveway, can I report this as well? Or am I an asshole tenant and is this just a lost cause and I should just look into new apartments even sooner than I was planning to?",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,,,,,0.25
5b60e59cda52255c20cffd64,"[California] Tenancy Law / Want to prevent my brother from establishing tenancy in my grandma's house. The house is in a trust that I control.. My grandmother owns a house in California. She is in a memory care center with late stage Alzheimer's. I have POA on all her medical, financial and legal affairs and the house is in a trust that only I control.  
  

&amp;nbsp;

My father has been allowed to live in the house for many years. He's a disabled senior who is undergoing treatment for cancer.     


&amp;nbsp;

My brother was incarcerated about a year ago for a variety of criminal charges including weapons, possession and theft. His previous residence was raided multiple times and he squatted in the house for many months after being evicted. He was dealing drugs there.    


&amp;nbsp;

He was released from jail a few days ago. He currently has no place to live.  Many of my family members have been harassing me and trying to convince me to allow my brother to move into my grandma's house. My father does not want him there but feels pressured and obligated to help my little brother so he's reluctant to give a firm 'no'.  


&amp;nbsp;

I realize that my safest bet to protect the house is to file a restraining order. But that would involve seeing my family in court and a trip to SoCal which I try to avoid at all costs since it reminds me of the fact that I had to grow up around these people.


&amp;nbsp;

*Other relevant info- My mother is an abusive narcissist who despises that I ever have something that she can't use or destroy and even though I've told her that my grandma gave me legal control of the house, she said that what happens there is 'none of my business'. My brothers have broken valuable objects of mine when they've been angry at me for not letting them use that house. They keep dropping by the house to ask my father for a foot in the door like, ""Well can he just stay for the weekend?"" I've had to fly into SoCal on several other occasions over the past few years to sort out problems arising from my chemically-dependent brothers and their sometimes violent friends.


&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - Can my brother establish residency in a house because my father is living there and allows him to stay? If so, how can I prevent it since I'm not physically in the location? My father is a legal tenant but I control the house.

5b60e59cda52255c20cffda8,"[Dallas, TX] Our apartment is dragging their feet on maintenance, and I want out.. I apologize for the long ass post. I wanted to try and get all the relevant details in about my predicament.

I moved into my current apartment a little over a year ago, and my current lease is up in November 2017. My boyfriend also lives with me and is a co-tenant on the lease. The complex has been decent so far and has usually been prompt in regards to maintenance requests. My main issue only started a few weeks ago.

A few weekends ago, I came home to find that my sink and dishwasher were backing up with water. It was so bad that water had begun to seep out the front door. We contacted the emergency maintenance around 10:30 that night, and even though someone called to say that the maintenance manager would meet with us that night, no one ever came. For good measure, I also put in an online maintenance request, which seems to be about the only way this complex will take your problems seriously. A maintenance person did come out the next day, and at the time it seemed the issue has been resolved.  

The next week, water started to back up in the sink again. The kitchen didn't quite flood like it had the last time, but we were still concerned. My boyfriend called the leasing office a few times directly about the issue, and no one was ever sent out. Then, on June 30th, our air conditioner went out. Texas is having a bought of 100 degree weather right now, so our apartment has been at a constant temperature of about 80 degrees. It's kinda of livable with a fan on, but not really my preference. On June 1st, I put in an online maintenance request for both the air conditioning and the plumbing. 

On July 5th, maintenance came by while my boyfriend and I were at work, and a window ac unit was installed in the bedroom. The way it was installed in the window makes it to where our bedroom basically has no privacy. There's not really an room for a curtain to be hung up; we have vertical blinds that were installed by the complex. Because of how long the blinds are and where the unit is placed, the blinds are basically parted so that anyone can peek into the bedroom. For now, I've tacked up a blanket to cover the window just to get some privacy. 

That same night, the dishwasher flooded AGAIN. We put in a second pending work order online since the complex seems content to ignore phone calls. We didn't hear back from anyone until July 7th. My boyfriend was home from work that day and a maintenance worker, who supposedly was fixing the AC, came by and asked for access to the breaker box. My boyfriend asked if maintenance had been notified about the second plumbing issue as well, and the worker said that no one had told him anything about it, and that we should call the office (which we've already done!!!)

So right now, I have no central AC, a bedroom with an ac unit and no privacy, an 80 degree living room (because the air from the ac unit doesn't reach in there), I have a plastic tub full of dirty ass water that's leaking from my kitchen fixtures, and another tub full of dirty dishes that we can't wash because doing so will probably cause another flood of biblical proportions. 

So getting to the nitty gritty legal stuff. my lease states that the ""unlawful early move-out and reletting charge"" is $600. The lease that we signed just uses the form provided by the Texas Apartment Association, which can be found here: https://www.taa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2015_Apartment_Lease_Contract_-_FINAL_1-16.pdf. Paragraph 31 states that they have an obligation to make all reasonable repairs within a reasonable amount of time. I'm wondering how long I'm supposed to play around with these people until I can just get out of this hellhole. I'm posting here to see if there might be any other legal remedies besides just eating the costs and paying to break the lease. If you have any questions for me, I'll try to answer them. Thank you for your time.

TL;DR: Apartment can't get their shit together and fix our maintenance issues. How long do they reasonable have to fix them, and is there a way out if they don't?",,0.25,,,0.25,,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.75,0.25,,,,0.25,,0.25

5b60e59cda52255c20cffdf3,"[NJ] Just was attacked and had to use my pepper spray. I went to a big box store and parked. When I got out I was stuck between two large SUV which limited my view going back. I honestly slowly went back when a car blasted their horn and sped. I would say around me but at no time were we closer than 8 feet. I let it go I did not even honk back or give them the finger or yell anything to them.

I had already put my windows down because the temperature was only ~80 degrees. My mistake. I happened to use the same exit as that person because there are only really two ways to get out.

I left at least one car space probably more. The passenger gets out of the car. Cars are coming into the big box store so I cannot go around. I am blocked on the right by a sidewalk and the passenger coming at me. There are cars already behind me.

The guy comes at me with fists drawn and in a threatening manner already yelling ""I am going to kick your fucking ass."" I panic and remembered I had pepper spray. I fumble for it as he is already at my car screaming. I yell ""GO back to your car"" at least 4 times and he takes a swipe at me and then spits at me right into my face and eye. I spray the pepper spray directly into his face. He immediately walks away and then his wife (driver of car) starts screaming at me. I call 911 the moment the situation was calmer.

He and she are screaming at me. I finally close my window (I forgot to do that) The police are there in about two minutes which is really quick. I tell my story. The other guy is warned to stay over there cause he keeps trying to get close to me. The police tell me that his story does not make sense and to tell me my story twice now. 4 more officers come. I tell them each and they warned me that I might be arrested because pepper spray is ""illegal"" in new jersey and that ""spitting does not constitute an assault""

Luckily a supervisor says that my pepper spray (bought on amazon which limits which size I can buy in my state) is legal and that spitting does constitute an assault or something else. I was still quite amped up to understand exactly what he said.

At the end, all of the officers told me had it happened to them they would have done the same or even more (one officer said I would have beat the living shit out of him) But they gave me my license, my pepper spray back, and a police report number no ticket was issued to me. I am not sure of the other person.

They said that the passenger already said that he will be pressing charges against me. The police told me at 9 am Monday to go to the police station pick up the police report and file charges against the passenger.

I would like to know what am I facing? Can I use a self defense claim? I never left the vehicle, he came into my vehicle trying to punch me and spit into my face.

What would I counter charge him with? Can I press charges against the driver of the vehicle as well as she preventing me from leaving.

5b60e59cda52255c20cffe50,"[FL] Fiance's is not able to see his daughter. Obligatory this post is not about me but about my fiance (22 M). It is also necessary for me to say that him and I live in WA but his daughter lives in FL so this is a Florida state matter.

So my fiance got a girl pregnant when he was living in Florida. The child is now three years old (possibly 4 but I am pretty sure she's only 3). Anyway, his daughter was born while he was in basic training and he is now active duty military stationed here in WA which is where I met him and it is where he has been since. The mother of his child requested that he have a paternity test and he agreed. This was a little over a year ago.
Since he has taken the test (it was positive), he has had to pay an ordered amount in child support since then which is automatically deducted from his pay and was slammed with owing around $12,000 in back child support which he now makes extra payments every month on that as well to keep him from going to jail.
Additionally, the mother of his daughter refuses to let him see her or even have any contact with her. He always pays his support since he has had to and has no criminal history of any kind or any reason for him not to see her. I assume since he is required to pay child support, he has joint custody of the child even though he does not live there. He is also not named on her birth certificate.

So my question for anyone who has been in this situation before or anyone who has knowledge of FL laws regarding this, what rights does my fiance have to see his daughter and additionally, is it right that he now owes so much money in back child support from before he took the paternity test and how can we resolve this situation for him?

Also, there is talk from him about wanting to surrender his rights over. His logic is that if he isn't allowed to see her, why bother paying child support for her. So fine people of Reddit, can you give me any advice?",0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,0.75,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,,,0.25,,0.25

Any possible recourse?. So mom and I bought roundtrip tickets from Kansas City to Fuzhou, China on JustFly.com. Outgoing flights were KC to Seattle to Shanghai to Fuzhou. Return flights were Fuzhou to Beijing to Seattle to KC.  

When we arrived in Shanghai, we had to hop on a different, domestic Chinese airline (Juneyao Air) to go to Fuzhou and get another boarding pass. The agent there did not give us any boarding pass since they said that whomever purchased the ticket (JustFly.com) had sent some kind of incorrect ticket/reservation confirmation number and it didn't match any of our passport or visa numbers. We were stuck in Shanghai and were told that the only way to get to Fuzhou was to buy our own separate ticket in China to go to Fuzhou. Which is what we did. 

When we were coming back to the US, at the airport in Fuzhou they said that the rest of our reservation was cancelled since we did not take the last leg from Shanghai to Fuzhou. We had to then buy tickets that day to come back to the US...which cost us double what we paid for the entire roundtrip ticket. 

Just called JustFly.com now to discuss any possibility of refund (we have receipts in China of flights we bought) and they flat out refused. They said that 1) any missed leg causes rest of the roundtrip to be cancelled....and 2) that if the confirmation # was wrong then we wouldn't have been able to even start our journey.  

Any potential recourse? Dispute this with my CC company(Chase?) The roundtrip ticket itself was about $2600 and the way back out of China was over $3000 (about 20,000 Chinese RMB converting to USD currency). So total out 5-6k.

I moved into an apartment in CT back in May 2016 which turned out to be horrible due to no wall insulation and an unstable downstairs neighbor who moaned when I had females over for fun then smoked cigarettes and denied it and made me ill from second hand smoke. I later found out from a next door neighbor that the prior tenant living in my apartment abruptly left after a few months due to similar reasons to mine. Calls to management made no difference and they denied any smoking or problems with neighbor. They even went as far as threatening eviction for stating I was causing him a disturbance, refusing my calls about the eviction threat then stating it was sent by mistake by their Jewish lawyer during their holiday. Despite all of this, I received a lease renewal request in March 2017 and was too busy with work (I work in a hospital) to look for apartments or sign the renewal. Finally got to a point where my neighbor continued to smoke and then harass me with total denial by him and management and I decided to get the hell out.

I recently was driving long distance when my tire blew out on the highway.  I put in the spare and drove to the nearest rural town but everything was closed since I got there on a Sunday.  I stayed overnight and in the morning went to one of the local tire shops.  They said my tires were old and all needed to be replaced (which turned out to be true), but that they only had two tires that were the right size.  So I got the two front tires replaced on my car and drove to the next nearest town to another tire shop that replaced the other two.  After my long long road trip I finally made it to my destination.  The next day one of the new front tires was flat.  I had to put the spare on again and drive it to Pepboys, and the folks there said the two front tires were the wrong size and poorly installed, and that the damage to the flat one was irreparable since it was probably poorly installed.  So basically I had to replace two brand new tires to get the correct size.  I will never go back to the rural town hundreds of miles away so I can't return the poorly sized and improperly installed tires, so I left them at Pepboys.  Anyway this has all been extremely frustrating and costly and I am totally unsure what to do.

My dad, after losing my mom and my sister, recently decided to move and build himself a new place, he picked a place mostly for the view in a remote village here in Belgium. Now the neighbouring farm started making plans for a giant metal barn right across the whole damn place 50 meters long, they're known to be intentionally mean here amongst locals, they told my dad it was gonna be placed in a way that would block the view much, that we would only see the width of it. Now the building permit got accepted and my dad could finally check it (he couldn't before) and it's the whole damn length of the thing, 50 meters long, right across the field. Now that the permit got accepted, we can't apparently do anything or at least that's what I'm told, on top of that in Belgium they generally let farmers build anything anywhere without much of a question's asked. These people have a lot (a lot!) of land and could place that barn virtually anywhere (including places where it wouldn't bother anyone obviously), they intentionally misguided for months my 70 year old dad and he's too nice to do anything.

The lot behind my house is not buildable, due to a Riparian Buffer that runs the length and width of the lot (because it contains a creek).

He was able to purchase the lot at a low price (~$3K), when other lots were selling for $20K (now worth $85-100K), because North Carolina had just passed the new law on Riparian Buffers and the seller took advantage of his naivete.

We'd like to purchase his lot because the property line is at such an angle - we'd really like to build out our fence onto his property and give ourselves a square back yard.  Negotiations have stalled, but he did tell me on the phone that he would be open to us building the fence and improving the enclosed ground, but that it would be on the condition that we'd remove the fence if he or another owner obtained a building permit - and that he'd have to think about it.

I have also had to be out of work the last 2 weeks for recovery. We have already started the claims process (I had insurance as well as the other driver) and so far, everything seems to be going along okay. I have never been in an accident before, so i'm not familiar with the process or anything, but everyone I know has been urging me to seek out a lawyer and try to get compensation for pain and suffering for myself and my 2 sisters, and also to cover my time off, and any medical bills associated with the injuries for the accident.

A little background: 

I purchased a key from a dealership which was sold 2 days after my purchase. The key caused damage to my vehicle ($600 worth).   
  
I attempted to reach out to [who I believed the previous] owner was for reimbursement(I contacted their 2nd dealership); was told no at first; then given an offer of full reimbursement for my damages that was rescinded after filing a consumer complaint against the LLC. 
  
I sued the LLC that owned the dealership I contacted for repairs (they were the previous mgmt/owners).   
  
At commissioners court, the LLCs' attorney told me that I sued the wrong people; claiming instead of the LLC I should have sued an Inc  that supposedly ran the business. [which was apparently defunct, thus uncollectible] but she did not have the paperwork to prove it, saying she'd be better prepared and would submit it if I did take it to court.   
  
I accepted an offer way too below what I was seeking to be done because I was stressed out and wasn't prepared for this curveball.   

  
I'd like to file a motion to reopen but I'm unsure if I'm allowed to. 

The reason I want to reopen is that I found evidence of the LLC (doing business as) the dealership which I bought the Key from, filed with the city they are located in.   
  
Note: the registered agent of the [maybe defunct] inc., and the LLC are the same with the same office too.

We've been woken up multiple times by them working on loud cars in the middle of the night. 


I finally snapped, took a photo of multiple infringements, and sent it to the HOA. First time filing a complaint, our HOA claims reports are anonymous. The HOA apparently forwarded my photo to the home owner, who then gave it to the renters.


A little about the photo: The people in the photo are in the (public) street, profile view, and too far away to get a proper ID. Their house is in the photo with it's house number legible. They of course have no way of proving specifically who took the photo, simply that it likely came from my house.


So anyway, renters come over furious and start spurting nonsense about having a police officer in the family and they said taking a photo like that was illegal and they could sue me, on and on. I told them to go ahead and do whatever they thought was necessary.


Now I'm second guessing myself. My understanding of photo/video/etc taking legality in Colorado, USA is that if that unless it's somewhere that privacy should be expected (ie a bathroom, changing room, etc) it's perfectly legal to take a photo of them without their consent. It is of course best to err on the side of caution, like definitely don't go taking photos through an open window, etc. A public street is clearly uh public, right?

In April, I made the personal decision to leave my apartment due to personal conflicts with my roommate. We are both on the lease and I asked to either have my name removed from the lease, or to terminate all together. She refused to comply with either of those options out of spite. There is no contractual agreement between me and my roommate stating that we would pay our share of the rent, only a contract with the landlord(the lease). I have been paying the second half of the rent out of fear of what may happen if I choose to stop.

The tenants will have 3 days to either pay the late rent, vacate the apartment, or fight the eviction in court. Now with that being said, having the eviction to my renter's history IS NOT A BOTHERSOME to me. I also understand the landlord may sue for missing rent.

a now former friend is demanding i pay back a small debt of 1400 AUD it used to be 1900 AUD, but its gotten to the point where i was sick of the abuse and stuff that ive blocked her from all comms between us.

Do i need to still pay the person back despite the debt being over 10+ years?

Heres what i know according to legal id Queensland &amp; Victoria (A me being in Queensland and her in Victoria)

Both Legal Aid QLD and Victoria both have stated that since its been 10+ years since the debt has been and that she never asked for it back originaly back in 04 sometime when she got me back home out of her own pocket for a flight via Qantas Australia, Both have stated that she really doesnt have a case in the courts as its over the time period and realisticly no judge or lawyer would want to touch the case as it would cost more in laywer fees then the case or money itself.

However, wanting to double check and recheck or basises and asses, Ive come to you guys asking.

5b60e59cda52255c20cfff91,"[MO] Driveway is sinking on a new house. Options and next steps?. Hey LA, 

I am posting on a throwaway just in case. I am looking for advice and intelligent next steps on getting this issue resolved. 

My partner and I built and bought a townhouse from a builder here in MO. Custom built, finished and closed end of Dec 2016. The driveway was poured in December. In March/April we noticed the driveway started to sink and part of it started popping up and separating from the ground. 

I email the warranty people at the builder, and they said the best they can do is pack underneath the driveway to keep it from sinking more. 

Well I went out and measured today and on one side it has separated 2 inches from the driveway and the other side is 3 inches. Upon some fun googling (which is probably not accurate), but a driveway should not be sinking or settling that much in this short of a time frame unless something was faulty with installation or the land they put it on. It's to the point of stopping our cars as we roll up the driveway in to the garage. We are worried about something underneath causing it to sink this quickly, resale value, and a potential accident by having to give a decent amount of gas to get up over that bump. 

What are the next steps to formally request or provide evidence that they installed it incorrectly? Should we get an inspector? Just email the warranty woman back letting her know we need to escalate? I just don't want to be railroaded. They've ignored my emails about issues before or just repeat the same shit back.

So here's the situation. 

I'm 8 months pregnant, my husband went to work for a company to go tree planting for a couple of months. 

Turns out it's a shitty company and he wants to leave early. He told the boss that he needs to come back to help me, as I'm on sick leave currently. 

His boss said two things that are making me scratch my head. 

1. He needs me to provide a sick note detailing why I'm sick and what's wrong with me. I told my husband that in the note I provided my employer, it didn't say anything about why I am sick, just that I am sick and that I will be off work from this date until this date. 

2. Then he said that if my husband leaves now, instead of paying per tree, my husband will get paid minimum wage for the hours worked. My husband also said that he can stay for one more week. 

My husband doesn't have a copy of his contract, and will talk to his boss tomorrow to get a copy. 

I'm just wondering about the legalities of leaving a contract early, and if the boss can change the rate of pay in this situation. 

Also I tried looking into family sick leave in MB, and I found a phone number I can call to ask more. Unfortunately tomorrow is Sunday and I may have to wait until Monday to call. 

Also if he is in a different province, what provinces labour laws should he be following, assuming this company is a MB company?

My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.  

Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more . 

This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery 

At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent. 

We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.

5b60e59cda52255c20d0004c,"[Oregon] Facing loosing Medicaid right when I have to leave work due to mental illness and unsafe work environment. Help?. (suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.

At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.

I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was ""I'll talk to you when I get back"" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule. 

Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there. 

This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting. 

But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying ""I'm too sick to work"" contradicts ""The way you run this place is inhospitable for me"".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there. 

What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?",,,,,,,,,,,,0.75,,,,,,,,0.75
5b60e59cda52255c20d000ca,"Altercation with neighbors...again. Currently residing in NYS and have been having on and off problems with our neighbors. We rescued our dog over a year ago and as a result of going through whatever she went through, she is experiencing problems with anxiety and fear of other dogs. We have been working with a certified trainer for almost a year and have been making great progress. We use a gentle leader, which goes around her face, and due to her dominant tendencies she will paw at it trying to get it off randomly and this sometimes leads her to stand on two back legs with us trying to calm her down. Anyways, when walking we have gotten a lot of positive feedback from neighbors about how well we're doing and the progress we've made. Except for one. The male and female that live a few houses down decided to approach us aggressively saying that we're abusing our dog and swearing, screaming, but not getting too close to us. Even when we tried to explain the training situation, they didn't want to hear it and kept yelling, so we went into our house. This happened about a month ago and due to feeling threatened at the time, we called the police within an hour of it happening. The officer showed up and after telling the situation he said that we are within our rights to train our dog how we want and if they approach us again to tell them to go away. Fast forward to a few days ago. We were walking again in our neighborhood walking and our dog pawed once at her halter and all of a sudden  the same female yelled something, however, we ignored it and kept walking. Shortly after, the female drove her car up and started yelling and cursing again. We replied with we're working with a trainer and we called the cops after last time and we were told we're within our right to train our dog how we see fit. She replied with we're lying and she's within her right to follow us and also said they've called the cops. After ignoring her, she drove off and we turned around to go back to the house. As we came closer to our house, the male was walking down the street yelling something, but we just ignored him and went inside. Again, we called the police and four officers showed up soon after. Upon answering the door, our dog was at the door where they could see and later the officer said that she looks fine and could tell nothing was happening. Anyways, after explaining the situation, one of the officers basically said to go about our business and there's really nothing they can do at this point and if they approach us again, to call the police again. I also should add that after mentioning the neighbors said they've been calling the police, the police confirmed that no one has ever called them. 

Our question is what can and should we do within our legal rights? Currently, we feel unsafe and are planning to go elsewhere to walk our dog. We don't like this because we bought our house and want to enjoy the area, but at what costs? These individuals could escalate the situation to something bad next time, but we also don't think it's fair for us to go elsewhere to walk. Even though there wwere no immediate threats, this still feels like harassment. We don't want the situation to escalate or get out of hand, but at the same time, we don't feel safe or that we're able to enjoy our home and neighborhood.

I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.

When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay. 

My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made?

What's the legality behind that? Is it just a matter of companies not going after small time artists and hoping they don't notice you? Is there a difference between selling a drawing of a companies character in their original costume vs designing a costume with that character in it? Does it matter?  What about accepting commissions to draw a companies IP?

With those out of the way - I plan on selling original artwork of my own design at conventions starting next year. What can I do to protect myself? How would you go about income tax (Specifically MO/KS tax laws regarding artwork sold)or licensing original content? If someone stole artwork from me what would be my best course of action?

5b60e59cda52255c20d00107,"[Virginia] Am I in a position to seek a protective order?. I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.

This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed). 

Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.

We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".

I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so. 

I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.

Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?",0.7368421052631579,0.25,0.25,0.6271186440677966,0.7222222222222222,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.625,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25

My siblings and I weren't close with him, he wasn't a nice guy. My mother wants no part of anything to do with him.

So, I met with a local estate lawyer who was willing to handle everything, but he wanted a $3000 payment up front that would cover all costs associated. He said that if we were to put it on a credit card, we could get money out of the estate that he would be opening in order to pay it off before the next payment is due. My siblings and I, being young, don't have access to that amount of capital up front, and with my mother not wanting to get involved, I don't know what to do.

2. Are there any services that you're aware of that could pay the money up front for a fee, that we could pay back quickly from the estate

My girlfriend is a film student currently in college. She is working on a project for a friend, where she is producing a promotional short for a proposed product. This *is not* for a class, but rather for a startup competition done through our college. 

For part of the project, her friend would like footage of the inside of a retail store. He has a specific big-box store in mind, and has reached out to a manager of that specific location.

This whole thing leaves me a bit uneasy. I know that there are a lot of protections for work related to education, but I highly doubt that this project would fall within them.

Six years ago while I was in college I did the stupidest thing and made a porno with an ex-boyfriend. I found a guy online who had his own site and shot the videos himself. The site seems low budget and all of the other couples on the site weren't well known stars, just everyday people wanting to try something new with their partners or to be able to watch themselves have sex. 

I was CLEARLY out of my mind when I decided to do this but I thought I really needed the money. I had actually forgot about it until me and my now fiancé opened up about our deepest secrets. He didn't seem mad just disappointed because it's way out of character.  Being that the performance with my ex was weird and awkward, I thought maybe the guy never uploaded it to the site. And he never emailed me that he did. I just happen to go through some old emails and found the site and my video. 

I was thinking of emailing him and asking if he could take it down. But I'm afraid that this will cause a series of unnecessary attention, he'll say no and then upload it to pornhub or something (if he hasn't already). The guy though was seemed pretty decent for this to be his hobby and didn't give off that type of vibe. But you never know.

So I will ask my question, and if people suggest hiring a lawyer, then I request advice on how to find the right type of lawyer for my situation. 

After graduating from college, I spent six months working on a startup which was unsuccessful. Then I began searching for a job, and I put my accomplishments during my startup on my resume. After six months of job searching, I received my first job offer with a company in the same field as my startup, but it's a 3-month consulting agreement. The CTO of the company said if it's a good fit I will be offered a full-time position afterward. I read the consulting agreement and analyzed it with a plagiarism checker. I discovered over 90% of the contract came from two online contracts, and one major difference I found was the removal of a phrase in a statement. To summarize the statement, the online contract says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc, that I develop while performing my services under this agreement"". The contract I received does not have the last phrase so the statement says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc."".  I spoke with the CTO about this, and he said I could make changes to the contract, and they would consider it. At the moment, I had doubt in negotiating and told him I sought a permanent position. So I declined the offer. A week later I regretted not negotiating and asked for another opportunity. He said they might give me another opportunity, but they will be unable to change the wording of the contract. If I sign the contract, is it possible that I will give them rights to all my accomplishments I achieved during my startup?

Started a new job recently at a restaurant in a busy neighborhood. Not sure on the specifics  of the restaurants income. I worked 50+ (more like 50.5-52.0 hours) on the first week of my work week. I approached my employer after I got my check and my shift was done and asked if I was owed OT for the week I worked 50 hours. My employer said OT is only required for 80+ hours in a TWO week period. I pointed out I had worked 81.80 hours in my pay period and didn't receive 1.80 hours of OT if that was in fact the case. I also told him all of my previous jobs, which admittedly have been big business/corporate (compared to this family owned business) have paid me OT after 40 hours in one week. He gave me a run around and I pretty much got no where with him.

1). Is this legal in MN? Seems MN law dictates OT can only be applied after 48 hours in a 7day period, which still at MINIMUM (correct if wrong) would me I owuld have 2ish hoours of OT.

I was on my off day and took an out of town trip with my wife and kids in the family minivan. We started to approach the small town of Uniontown AL and I was immediately pulled over by a police officer (he passed me going the opposite direction then proceeded to do a unturn to get behind me). I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam. 

I know the obvious answer is to ""lawyer up"" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction?

5b60e59cda52255c20d003ab,"My parents are going through a divorce due to my mothers alcoholism. How can my fathers finances be protected from her?. *Location: England*

My parents are about to go through a divorce through no fault of my Father. My mothers alcoholism has gotten worse over the years and my dad can no longer take the emotional turmoil no more. She is stuck in a cycle and will not seek help or change her ways so my dad has to go. The turning point for me was my mother was diagnosed with esophagus cancer at 47 (very rare) due to her obsessive smoking and alcohol abuse. She was given a second chance after operating and was all clear but slowly slipped back to her old ways before getting much worse.

Divorce in the UK is a very financially toilsome outcome for the male party and I want to know how my dad can keep what he has worked hard for without my mam prying everything away? He is essentially the victim of years of emotional abuse and it is completely my mothers failings that have forced him into divorce so why should he have to pay for her failings.

Information that may be of use when giving advice:

- Three kids together. One 16, one 22 (me) and another 23. Only myself and my younger brother live at the family home.
- My dad worked away a lot for the first 18 years or so of my life whereas my mam was a housewife. 
-My mother got a job a few years ago as my dad needed help with the bills but then was diagnosed with cancer one year ago and has been on the sick since
- She is able bodied and in my eyes should be in work
- The house is up for sale and my father is in contact with the solicitors to go through divorce proceedings. I'm pretty sure both names are on the mortgage.

I would love my father to be able to part ways with this woman and get on with his life instead of paying my mother a 'lifestyle allowance'.  He has worked incredibly hard his entire life and shouldn't be forced into giving some alcoholic more money to spend on alcohol. I am not naive to the fact that my mother is obviously entitled to something but she certainly shouldn't be entitled to everything with this being her fault.

5b60e59cda52255c20d003ef,"Advice on how to report police corruption. Long and short of it is I come from a very small town.  On top of issues with the department I have going back to when I was a little girl (they mishandled my sexual assault/abuse case that or another case of corruption I'll never know)  Since school got out there's been an obvious up-tick in noise around the neighborhood.  Oddly last year wasn't bad.  This year it's non stop atv's and dirtbikes, drinking, and yelling about ""teeners"" from the front steps at 1-3 am every morning.  I called to report noise two days ago.  dispatch asked , ""When you say yelling do you mean partying and having a good time?""  I said, ""if you're asking if they're fighting no but it's 1 am and they lit fireworks off outside my two daughters windows.  He sighed and said ok, ""you wanna talk to the deputy?""  I said ""no I wanna go back to bed"" he said ""ok deputy is in route.""  

Deputy never showed.  I know because the fireworks continued and every time my daughters came back to my room freaked out and tired.   (it's worth mention that I have two years worth of video showing the same officer going to the same house in our cul-de-sac and staying for 45 mins to an hour a couple times a week.  They are no stranger to this home)  

Last night we had 7-15 rounds fired in the center of town from a fairly loud gun.  They shot from 1-1:30 then 1:40-2 they took a break and resumed shooting until 3 am.  I lost count of rounds after that.  Police never showed up to that either. 

Rewind over the last six months.  My brother in law is a crackhead.  (No joke) My MIL passed away almost 3 years ago.  Out of her passing we ended up taking the house as the sister was engaged in a lease and crackhead wouldn't pay the bills.  We let him stay in the house for two months until the eviction letter came and we had to take over.  So in lieu of house their sister said give him the truck. 

He's never changed the title, never put tabs on or insured the vehicle.  It is still registered to his late mothers name.  

this is where the corruption comes in.  He's been pulled over multiple times.  6 in the last 9 months to be exact.  over the course of three years?... countless. Every time up until recently he's called my husband to come pick him and the truck up.  He's caught driving with a suspended license (from not paying child support, has been suspended since shortly before their mom died)   The first couple times the hub went and got him.  The third time he asked the officer, ""Why don't you impound the vehicle and throw him in jail?""  (line of thinking is maybe he'll have a chance to sober up)

The officer called in a female officer for ""back-up"" and she informed him that they all know their mom died so they know he's going through a hard time.  Just take the vehicle and him home. 

He was pulled over again two weeks ago.  Still suspended ,still unpaid fines.  Police still won't impound the vehicle.  We just got a letter from the DMV here under MIL's name saying that tabs and new plates were due this year.  

My husband said we should take that letter up to the DMV and tell them the vehicle is scrapped.  

There is so much more into the corruption than just this piddly stuff however I don't know how much they can actually watch/read. 

My mom works fairly closely with police in her public position a couple of them have gone as far as telling her how they investigate.  That they can read through facebook messages without permission (legal I guess)  so I didn't want to ask her how to report as I really don't want a ""Walking Tall"" thing to go down.  

How do I go about bringing a corruption charge against the police?  These things seem very minor I'm sure but as I said I have far more proof's I'm just not sure what I should do with it. (video, pictures, recorded conversations, multiple attempts on my end to contact said department)  Located MN

After removing the tenants, the city received an ""anonymous"" tip that my units were being rented on AirBnB. During the hearing, the lawyer that represented these previous tenants happened to be at court, and mentioned that he heard the owner (myself) planned on renting the units via AirBnB directly.

I ended up getting fined $3500. I never said this, nor did I ever intent to rent via AirBnB. I obviously plan on appealing, but I did manage to find a previous AirBnB listing for my property that was removed here: http://airbnb.com/rooms/12874458

I'm honestly wanting a little justice, and was curious what you all might recommend.

Their attorney obviously sticks out for malpractice, but if I can get this listing info from AirBnB, then I can show the previous tenants were renting the apartment and not me. I just emailed AirBnB to try and get this basic info like the listing, description, who rented it, and the reviews.

Storytime: yesterday night, since we don't have an appartment, my girlfriend (16, legal in our country, Croatia) and I (22) decided to have intercourse in my car on a spot we have used have used for the same purpose many times. It's a forest area next to a dead end road, across which there are some private properties, but the area we used is no-ones property. It was around midnight.

We had a passengers seat window opened. Before foreplay my girlfriend heard some weird rustling in the bushes around us, but ignored it and blamed it on paranoia and anxiety, and we decided it's probably just bugs or a lizard.

We did some foreplay on the passenger seat, and then moved to the back seat behind drivers seat. She was on top and after at least 10 minutes if sex, heard the rustling again, so she turned to see a man crouching inches away from the door, masturbating. She screamed at him, at which point I screamed at him too. He got up and slapped his penis against the inside of my car, proceeding to masturbate for a moment before he ran away. We didn't even get dressed just turned the car and drove away in utter state of shock and powerlessness. We stopped at the first sight of streetlights not knowing what to do. We got to her place 20 minutes later unable to fall asleep and we just talked to get our minds off that.

At one point during the night I woke up hyperventilating and crying (I don't think I even have to mention what state she was in the whole time.). The next morning I decided that I have to do something about this but since I have no friends or family who could give me proper advice on this I decided to come here and ask for advice.

Who should I call? What should I say? Is there anything we can do to get him punished?

Her mother laughed at our petrified faces because it happened to her too in her youth. She also said the police wouldn't do anything if we told them and I am scared to tell them because that might've been treated as a public place.

Problem 4 - When I did try to reach this guy for additional information, he is very elusive and provides very little information other than threatening me with a lawsuit if I cancel this contract and is trying to extort a cancellation fee of $1,000 or if he goes to his lawyer, he's going to sue me for 25% of the total cost my insurance company paid me for replacement.

I log into a secondary FB account and navigate to his profile, and that I cannot start a chat with him with this secondary account. The 18yo has not blocked me, but disabled messenger.

I finally look at my message requests, and find that this stranger has messaged me:

""I'm calling [Local Police Force] right now. Reporting you for trying to have sex with a minor.""

Initially confuaed, but with a slow frightening realization, I book it. Haul ass off hotel grounds and take the long way home

This took place an hour and a half ago.

If what this stranger says is true, I could be charged with solicitation of a minor. I repeat again I was not aware that I was talking to a minor. No where in any of our conversations was there a number other than 18.

5b60e59cda52255c20d0058b,"(Canada) Question regarding Domestic case with my man and how to undo these things in the best way for both of us.. Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself. 
We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car. 

We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together. 

We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.

About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice. 

He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.

I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.

Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety. 

We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work. 

He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word. 

But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged. 

So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault. 

I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed. 
I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.

I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys. 
But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance. 

Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present. 
My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us? 
He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on.
Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault. 

I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him?
Can I recant my statement without being punished?
How do I fix this before it breaks our family?
Is there anything I can do?

Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story. 
He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.

5b60e59cda52255c20d005ad,"[AL] Just found out that I am the officer of a decade long abandoned corporation my father made. I am currently in FL, but the corp exists in AL.

tl;dr- In the late 90s, my dad created a ""Domestic Corporation"" (has the .inc at the end) when I was a minor, used it to do some masonry work, and then passed away in the early 2000s. Thanks to Google, I just found out that I'm named as an officer (incorporator) and it still exists.

--------------------------------

Setting: small semi-rural town in Alabama. 

So, back in the late 90s my father had an opportunity to take the masonry he worked as a 9-5 job and use it to form his own company and take on some really big projects. I was in 8th grade at the time. He created the corp with the help of a lawyer friend, rented a little shed somewhere for cheap and got to work with my grandfather on the first project. It didn't make massive money, but it made enough for him to quit his day job and keep the lights on, and that's all that mattered.

For the most part, I never got involved except for helping him work out at his shop after school some days, and sometimes during summers in high school. He had a lot to do, it was hard work to do alone and he had no help (never hired anyone; it was always just him), so I was happy to lend a hand. 

That said, I was never officially paid in any capacity. This was just the ""family business"" and I was doing my duty as his kid to help keep the lights on. I didn't mind.

By college, in the early 2000s, I pretty much went on about my own life, and the help I could offer decreased pretty greatly because of my own responsibilities.

Around that time, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and stopped working. He kept his warehouse, just paying rent to keep it around (I guess to keep the hope alive that he would be able to do it again one day), but in 2008 he passed away. After his passing, his widow (my stepmother) mentioned that the shop was still around and she was going to have to pay rent on it if it wasn't cleaned out, so I took some friends down and sweeped/washed it out, threw out the old tables, and brought whatever was left over back to her (the vast majority of the equipment he used was rented, so all that was left over were some old pallets, old wooden tables he cobbled together to do work on, and mechanic hoist that I took back to her). 

That was the last I ever thought of his corp.

Well, last night I was just sitting there being somewhat sentimental and thought to myself ""I wonder if anyone talks about the work he did anymore..."" and Googled his corp name. While looking, I ran across a Google business listing and clicked it. According to the site- the corp is still listed as ""Exists"" and it has 2 officers... my father and ME (both listed as ""incorporator).

After some panicking, I went to the AL corp lookup and looked the company up via ID there, and sure enough the information was legit. It is listed as a ""Domestic Corporation"" and has a "".inc"" at the end of the name. 

I had always assumed that it was his company alone, and that when he passed the corp would be shut down. And yet there it is. From what I can tell, Alabama will never administratively shut down a corporation on its own.

After looking, I realized that Alabama requires a minimum $100 annual filing fee each year (subject to fines each month you don't deal with it). Obviously no one has dealt with this since at LEAST 2008, and that's assuming he kept it up as he should have up until 2007. The registered agent is still listed as him, and pointed to his shop. The mailing address is some PO Box I don't even recognize (I guess he got his work mail there). 

Now, before anyone jumps to the obvious conclusion of ""This could have been nefarious"" - that wasn't something my father would do in ill will. The man would have taken a bullet for me, and DID sacrifice a lot of his own personal life and happiness to care for me. Also, I am intimately familiar with my credit, and nothing has ever shown up out of the ordinary on it. When he did this, I'm sure he did it for no other reason than he thought it would be ""cool"" for his son to be a part business owner at such a young age. And, unfortunately, I can't remember that conversation at all (it's been some 20 years...), so 8th grade me probably thought it was really cool, too.

In short- kinda freaking out. There is this corporation out there, somewhere, that I am an officer in which has been sitting derelict since at least 2008 amounting what I can only assume is a lot of debt. I have none of the paperwork (that I am aware of), and know little more than the name of the company and that it's my responsibility now.

I'm pretty sure this is lawyer territory, but it's Sunday afternoon and my stomach is doing cartwheels, so I wanted to ask what you all thought since I have literally nothing else I can do right now about the situation.

I recently found out that I'm going to owe over $3,000 to upgrade the elevators in my condo building - Chicago suburbs, IL. Our HOA fees are already ridiculous (close to $600 a month) and I was under the impression that part of the reason our fees were so high was that we were contributing towards funds that would take care of upgrades such as these.

The condos range anywhere from 80k-175k, so most residents are senior citizens on very fixed incomes, or young people getting their start in life. An unexpected $3,000 fee is REALLY stressing me out.

So I'm wondering. Do we have ANY rights at all? For example, should we have had the right to vote on this special assessment? Did they need to notify us? Shouldn't we have some sort of right to see what contractor they plan on hiring and vote on whether or not the amount is fair? I know when you submit yourself to an HOA building you are handing over rights, but I just can't imagine we wouldn't have SOME sort of legal protection - i.e. what if they just decided that they wanted to build a new swimming pool or upgrade the garage without our consent?

She spoke to Homes Inc. and they offered her $2,000 dollars for repairs to the floor in the areas where the leaks had happened. Keep in mind, this is still just a few months after her husband passed away and her whole world got turned upside down. She does not have experience with this sort of thing as her husband was the one to handle this kind of business. So she signed the very long paper and accepted the money. This money was not intended for any repairs to the concrete slab, it only paid to replace the damaged floor boards. What she failed to realize at the time was the true intent of this payoff. The document stated that Homes Inc. was exonerated from any blame for any future damage coming from this problem. It also said she was not allowed to speak to anyone about this or they could sue her. Now it's been months and she still gets leaks all over the house, in her bedroom, in her office, in the living room, in the kitchen. It's far and above a $1,700 job to repair and she feels terrible and trapped. She feels like she was completely deceived since they told her that the areas would dry out over time, yet this has clearly not been the case. She doesn't know what to do and quite frankly neither do I. I know hardly anything about the legality of all this, but I know the fact that she signed that document isn't a good sign.

Does she have any chance at legal action against Homes Inc. for repairs to her home? Who or what kind of lawyer would she need to speak to? I've heard of certain legal scenarios where the lawyers work for a share of the winnings. She doesn't have the money for a long and lengthy legal dispute, but could this be an option for her?",,,,,,,0.25,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5b60e59cda52255c20d006c5,"A shit ""friend"". A little over a year ago, against my advice (NEVER buy or sell a car or house from/to a friend), my husband took out a bank loan to purchase a vehicle from a buddy. The loan has been paid off for MONTHS and we still have not received said car or title. Maintenance had to be done, and every time he has fixed one thing he has damaged another part. Being a BMW, the parts have to be ordered each time. Friday he said he had a family emergency, naturally I don't believe a damn word. Whatever. What's another day at this point? Yday he says he left a light on in the vehicle, of course this ran the battery down. He had to take the battery to the shop he works at to charge it. Fine. Get it done. Never heard back. Today, we still haven't heard anything after several texts and messages. 

I've been ready to wash my hands of this since the very beginning. Husband has finally reached the point where he is ready to take legal action. Of course, we do not have the money to do this. I'm determined enough, we will find a way to pay for what we need to to get this taken care of, including him paying for the legal fees (if possible) in the end. 

I believe we paid $2500 for it. I've told him if we don't have the car, he will be paying for the loan we took our in full-time including interest. 

Ive never had to take legal action on anything and have no idea what the first step should be. I assume simply calling around tomorrow to local lawyers would be a good place to start.

TL;DR- Got lost in the health insurance system due to a glitch; now have a wisdom tooth tearing up my mouth and want to know if it's okay to get medical help despite being in an appeal process 

So! Back in December of 2016, I applied for health insurance via NY State of Health and uploaded my tax returns as proof of income (I'm freelance). I was then told I hadn't given enough information of proof of income despite uploading my tax return, so called the phone line to ask what more I needed to do. They told me tax documents were enough, it was a glitch in their system, and they would contact me when it was all settled. In February I hadn't heard from them yet, so called again to check in---was told once again that it was a glitch and they would contact me shortly.

Fast forward to now--I still hadn't heard from them, but apparently have a wisdom tooth that decided to show up in my mouth last week and wreck havoc (constant pain, hard to eat, hurts to swallow, all that fun stuff). I called the office again to check in, was told it was a massive error on their part and they got me set up to pick a plan (which I did), except it doesn't start until August--I cannot make it much longer like this, one week has already been hell. I then requested to file for backdating due to an urgent medical need, which was denied (not sure why entirely, more than willing to call and ask for specifics if that's helpful). 

I can expand on all of this further if the wall of text hasn't already been a turn off, but the basic questions I have are:

-now that I'm filing an appeal, is it okay to still get my tooth removed or does that hurt my standing in the appeal process?

-if I win this appeal will I be reimbursed for whatever costs my dental would've covered (if it's kosher to remove the tooth)?

-is it terribly stupid to not have someone to represent me for this telephone hearing?

We live on a lake in North Carolina where a development is going in across the street. Our driveway is directly across from one of the entrances to this new subdivision, which is mostly finished except for maybe 20 or so houses on the side of the subdivision closest to us. We had about 2.25 inches of rainfall in an hour or so yesterday which lead to a very large amount of silt deposited in our flower beds, in front of our garage door (some inside the garage), around the back of the house under our deck, etc etc. A large amount of debris traveled with the water and much of our mulch has been carried away.

As far as I can tell, the rainwater washed into the development's street, past the silt fences, quickly clogged the storm drains (because of the silt catchers they place in the drains), and then ran straight down the street, across the road between our house and the subdivision, and then down our driveway. I ran into the developer today who fed me a line about the gas company destroying the silt fence and not fixing it properly and how he's going to see if they'll fix it and clean up the silt for us. He was very clear that he's not going to take responsibility for the runoff because ""it was a 1,000-year rain that won't happen again"", and apparently other houses had mulch washed away (which I see no evidence of). He's going to send his guys out to start cleaning up the silt, but he won't pay for any landscaping because the water would have done that anyway. Which, of course, is complete BS because the silt clogged the storm drains. It seems to us, based on previous storms, that the installed drainage is not sufficient to deal with the runoff created by the subdivision. Whether or not it will get better once all of the houses are built and grass starts to grow, I can't say.

To be able to move in with me she couldn't afford July's portion of rent which was $425 for her. Her and her ex roommate agreed both verbally and over text that she would pay June and July utilities but my girlfriend would only have to pay for June's rent.

5b60e59cda52255c20d007f4,"My past roommate is threatening to take me to small claims court. So, me and my other roommate used to live with this girl that had to leave the state and decided to sublet her room in our house. She never moved her stuff out of the house and forced the subletter to live amongst her things.

The result of that was that the old roommate kept the majority of her possessions scattered throughout the house. Me and the other roommate just accepted it and agreed she could do so until her lease was up. 

So, her lease ended in July and she never came to collect her things. A totally new person signed the lease to her room and we had to fill our house with even more of her junk, her bed, etc to move the new person in.

She texted me and the other roommate that she would be by July 13th to pick her things up, but also demanded that we pay her money to buy her out of the things she contributed to which amounts to roughly 200 dollars. She said, or else she would take those items out of the house. I told her back in text ""I'm ok with you taking the things you paid for"" meaning not the items we co-owned together.

She also demanded that since after she moved out that we never took this couch cover and this rug off the ground for her that we both have to pay her the total brand new cost of those items which amounts to 90 dollars total.

She started harassing me and the old roommate with venmo for those items. I actually paid her some money, but my roommate is vexed at this situation especially because we had to live amongst her shit for almost a year, and hasn't given her any money.

Anyway, this morning she emailed us threatening to take us to small claims court and saying she had legal representation. She's taking me to court for the carpet and couch cover I never touched, and my other roommate for everything else.

I talked to her on the phone and told her that she should be grateful we took such good care of her things and didn't ask for a storage fee, but she said she didn't need to be grateful because her subletter agreed to live amongst her possessions. 

However, me and the other roommate on the lease never agreed to store her possessions, we are just nice people and didn't want drama. Now her lease is actually up, I reminded her she is not on the lease any longer, and she really needs to take her things, but she had some backwards logic about still being entitled to have access to the house

My roommates and I changed the locks because we are truly frightened that this person will retaliate in some way. I'm just wondering if she can really take me to small claims court for this petty tit for tat BS, I'm also wondering if I'm allowed to just put her stuff outside at this point.

So I'm really lost and in need of help on this, to my ex-girlfriend has had some mental issues for quite a while that she decides to take out on me. To get into the story I have another post that can provide further insight. Me and my EXgirlfriend have had an argument about her talking to other men and her exes, because of her anger issues she goes from 0 to 100 just like that and will cuss and throw things but in our most recent argument she decided to up and move overnight, this was while I was thinking that there was something going on with her and another man. Well sure enough one of her estranged family members and a random guy helped her move out in the process she had stolen a lot of stuff for me but returned some of it. The next day her and that guy came over and we're sitting in their car in front of my driveway until I came out and trying to harass me to give me my cat to her. Now this was a feral cat that was never owned by anybody except I always paid Veterinary bills and for all other living Essentials and also has lived at my house it's whole life. Well recently she decided I have committed domestic violence against her in that argument and that she wants the cat now, even though she has no proof it's her cat. In doing that I had a court order to return the cat and there was a court date in two weeks from now. She is trying to take my cat right now and the other day while I was at work 2 police officers and my ex showed up to get the cat but the cat was outside and I was at work so they had to come back in the next days. I have visual, text, and Witnesses that show she had made a false statement. Also after I was served a temporary restraining order until the next court date where I can provide everything she kept trying to provoke and contact me calling from different numbers until one time I answered and she said right away "" I'm sorry that was the only thing I could say or do to try and get that cat"" I told her to text it to me but of course she knew what she was doing and wouldn't. She has been talking before she moved out about moving out of state and this guy that she met is from one state away but when she told me he was only a friend at the time she said he's moving back to that state soon. I fear for the life and well-being of my cat or that she will send it off.

So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.

However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.

5b60e59cda52255c20d00914,"Copyrights: questions about public domain works and how to verify a work's copyright protections. Hi r/legaladvice,


This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.


I'm gathering preliminary sources and images for a book idea that I have. This book would consist mainly of images, illustrations, and hand-drawings that _mostly_ come by way of the Library of Congress or government agencies. The Library of Congress states that the government works hosted on their site *""are also available for worldwide use and reuse under CC0 1.0 Universal.""* However, they also state *""you should determine for yourself whether or not an item is protected by copyright or in the public domain, and then satisfy any copyright or use restrictions when publishing or distributing materials from our collections.""*


My concern is that second snippet. 

- How can I verify that a work is truly in the public domain (or equivalent license)? 


- If I do publish an image that I find out is not in the public domain after publication, what options do I (and the copyright holder) have? 


- What sites or services can you recommend that will ensure I only use works that are in the public domain?

PICTURES OF DAMAGE ARE LINKED AT BOTTOM OF POST

I posted in this subreddit a few weeks ago. Long story short, I own a twinhome. My neighbors are renters. One of my neighbors moved their sump pump hose right outside my basement window, and it proceeded to come into my basement destroying my carpet and padding. 

It was suggested in here to file an insurance claim, which I did. 

First I filed with my own insurance company, and they said they wouldn't cover it as they would consider it to be ""flood damage"" and I don't have flood coverage. They suggested to file a claim through the other homeowners policy policy, and it may fall under their liability coverage. 

So that's what I did. His insurance company sent out an adjustor, inspected the damage, and did his thing. A week later, I got a call from the insurance company saying they wouldn't cover it, since it wasn't their insured (the actual homeowner) that caused the damage, but rather the person renting the home from him. I asked if the homeowner has any liability for his renters actions, and the insurance company said no, not at all. 

So now I'm in my present situation.  I paid 2300 dollars for carpet and padding, which is going to be installed on Tuesday. Admittedly, this carpet is nicer than the carpet I had to take out (5 dollars a Sq foot as opposed approx 3 dollars a Sq foot for the original). 

I know my neighbor isn't going to want to pay for the damages they caused, as that is the nature of negligent neighbors. So I'm guessing my ultimate course of action will be to take them to small claims court. I'm only really armed with pictures of the damage as well as pictures of where my neighbor left his sump pump hose. Is this enough to get a judgment in my favor? I've never gone to court for anything, so any opinions are appreciated.

How do I protect myself if I need to file a workplace injury claim? And since I have healthcare regardless, do I really need to?. I'm 50 years old.

After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.

Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.

My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.

Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.

I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.

Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.

I recently had to cancel a long term Airbnb reservation in Bay Area California, because of host breaking the agreement on which we agreed on before reserving midway through my reservation. 

Airbnb's case manager handled the issue and it was agreed that I would be refunded for the nights not stayed in the reservation and would be refunded 50% for the nights since which host voided the agreement.
The case manager changed my reservation dates accordingly, however, since it was listed as a new reservation, the nightly price was hiked by my host (something I was neither informed about nor agreed to). The case manager also started saying I did not pay for all the dates of the reservation according to the new dates, and hence they will not refund me for them. However, according to the previous receipt and my bank statements I paid for the whole month. I mentioned it to them, but they disregarded this. Every time I try calling them on their phone line, they say they will email me. But their email just repeats what the case manager said.

5b60e59cda52255c20d00d5d,"(MI) My roommates and I are being sued, seeking guidance about a couple key points of the case.. As the title says, my roommates and I are being sued by a former landlord to the tune of roughly $7500 after a tenancy that stretched from 2014 until April of 2017. The bulk of the charges come from painting ($3000) and carpeting ($3200). In addition to these charges there are $600 in damages that they are attempting to charge us for that appear on the initial commencement checklist as being previously damaged, signed in 2014 at the outset of the lease. They are also suing us for their attorney's fees; one of my biggest questions regarding the issue is if they are allowed to do this and if so is there a limit to the amount we can be held liable for?

There are some damages we do not contest, such as wall dings, scratches, and a broken kitchen drawer, however, we assert that the ""damage"" to the paint and carpet was normal wear and tear over the course of a 3 year lease. Some of the paint in the home at lease origination was noted as ""freshly painted"", while other rooms were not. The carpets were dirty at the time of lease inception and one of the tenant's parents rented a carpet cleaner and cleaned them before they moved in, it is our belief that the carpets in the home may be original to the home (built 1997), but we do not know for sure.

A month later, she never returned. She told me via Facebook messenger that she'd be back in a few weeks for a while, then said this friend wanted to sign on to the lease. I told my roommate I wasn't comfortable with her friend doing that. About a week before the end of my roommate's lease, I told her ""friend"" that she had to leave, since I needed a new roommate and she wouldn't let anyone see her room. I asked for the keys and she assaulted me, throwing me on the ground and then calling the police saying I'd attacked her. The police came and threatened to arrest both of us, I cleared out and got a restraining order. Despite this, I couldn't get her out of the apartment and I no longer feel safe there.

5b60e59cda52255c20d00e59,"Landlord is asking us to do tasks for security deposit. Hey guys,
First submission, so excuse me if this is the wrong place or I did something against reddit rules.

Background- we left 6/23 and the Landlord has us pay for the full month. He originally called this a ""cleaning fee"" when we asked him why we would not be prorated(this was right before the beginning of June that we asked). The guy is a chill dude, he wasn't overly invasive or anything and seems pretty fair. He didn't take any money off for a scratch of paint in one of the bedrooms, nor from some scratches on the hardwood floor. We cleaned the house spotlessly (the last roommate to leave was supposed to get the oven and bathtub and didn't), just so that he didn't have a reason to take anything off of the security deposit... Not because we knew it was obligated to clean everything spotlessly or else get money deducted. 

Anyway, I call him a couple hours ago and he stated we didn't clean the oven or the bathtub so we could either clean it or be deducted money from the security deposit. I said, ""You said that we were being charged over $300 dollars for a cleaning fee, we cleaned everything just to be nice. Why do you need us to clean these things if we paid you $300 for you to do it?"" He said he didn't originally call it a cleaning fee and that 7 days was his time to get everything ready for the next renters. We bantered for awhile about why were are covering his time and whatnot to no conclusion.

I'm just curious if he can just make us pay for the seven additional days that we didn't live there? I see that he is, in his eyes, being""nice"" to allow us to clean it so it isn't out of our security deposit, but can he actually do that? Because the lease doesn't say we DON'T have to pay for the full month, it's my guess that he can charge us for the full month?

Probably important information:
-This was in Michigan.
-(I don't have the lease on me, I won't have it until tomorrow, but we thoroughly checked it for loop holes when this all started... I'm still lost so turning to reddit) However, the lease didn't state anything about a cleaning fee. It also didn't state that we would or would not be paying for the full month of June. The lease agreement did say that it was from 8/1/16-6/23/17.  It also gave us information that if we wanted to move in a couple days earlier we would be prorated for each day we moved in early at the beginning of the lease.

As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25.

Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do.

So I was involved in a hit and run collision this morning. I was stopped at a stop sign at an intersection and a Honda came around the corner too fast and too wide and smashed right into the left front of my car. As I was getting out they sped off and left me stranded. My left front wheel is bent and my steering arm is bent so I couldn't steer my vehicle. I managed to drive it back down the street to my aunts house house with the wheels pointing in opposite directions and the tires squeeling and park the car until a tow truck arrived. I called the police and they told me they wouldn't send an officer out for something like this and to make a police report online. I drove around the corner with my dad in his car and we found the vehicle that hit me. When he hit me his left front turn signal lens broke off and I picked it up. It matched exactly to the Honda we found around the corner. I wrote down the license plate number and took a lot of photos. I called the police a second time and told them I found the car who hit me and they still said they wouldnt send an officer out and to make a report at the station or online. I made a report online but when I did so it said that hit and run reports made online will not be investigated. When I got my car home I called my insurance company and made a claim. I only have basic liability and no uninsured motorist coverage so I don't think they can really do anything. They took all my information I had and told me I would receive a call back within two business days. I guess I'm going to be waiting on them to call me back but I almost feel cheated that my tax dollars are going to waste when the cops say they won't do anything. What kind of bs is that.

5b60e59cda52255c20d00eb0,"Apartment is being ""broken"" into, stealing candy, and relocking door. 3x this past week. I think it's my teenage boy neighbor.. tldr; Someone came into my apt 3 separate times this week and stole varying amounts of candy each time. Apartment may have same locks and key for various units.

Kansas City, MO. 
First off, let me start off with how my apartment building works. This is a fob entry building and you need a fob to get off any floor except the lobby. Which is why I believe it to be someone that lives in the building, namely my neighbor.

I have a roommate and we live in a small 2BR/2BA with a small entry way and living room. It's 6 regular steps to our living room, 14 to the kitchen, 15 and 17 to our rooms. I just want to show you how small it is. I came home Sunday from a 1 month trip visiting home while my roommate stayed here by herself. We have a candy bowl that I put candy in for guests and for ourselves. 

I come home and see it's half full. Two days later, it's completely empty except for two pieces of candy. I ask my roommate what she did with it all, that's a lot of candy. She said she didn't touch it and her bf didn't touch it. We're both kind of freaked out but think it's stupid that anyone would come in and steal candy and nothing else. I chalk it up to a memory lapse or maybe I have carbon monoxide poisoning and did it, etc etc. I still called the front desk to let them know it was happening and refilled the candy bowl with reese's cups and hershey's kisses. I also talked to my next door neighbor and asked if he saw or heard anything recently. He said no, sorry, and closed the door.
We just used a door jammer where even if unlocked, the door cannot be forced in. My 200lb brother couldn't even bust through it. I locked the doors and door jammed it every night until Thursday night, when I completely forgot to jam it. 

I wake up Friday morning to go to work and all the bright, orange reese's are gone. I freak out, wake up my roommate and tell her to stop fucking with me cause it's not funny anymore. She told me she was awake all night until 5am, there's no way someone came in. Then she asked me if I woke up around 3am and I said no. She had heard someone in the living room/kitchen but thought it was me getting a snack. We call the front desk again and I head off to work around 9am. 

My roommate heads off to work around 1pm and I got home around 3:30pm. Once again, the candy jar is completely empty except for the first two pieces they left the first time they stole our candy. So now they've escalated to daytime stealing. That is where I am left off night. Nothing has happened over the weekend. I called the police to report it over the phone but they want to physically come out and do a report. I went out of town and wasn't able to do it and my roommate worked all weekend. We also don't want to spook the thief because I really want to catch who is doing this. It's really freaking creepy and psychotic to just come in someones home to steal candy, just to fuck with us. 

I believe it is the teenage boy because he is only 13, can't drive, and is on summer break. He also isn't the sweetest kid ever. I've seen him throw things and yelling racist obscenities at street walkers for no reason (we share the same window wall).

I had believed that perhaps someone has a masterkey or were picking our locks but my roommate actually talked to a tenant on our floor. The tenant said that when she first moved in, her key worked on three other units. I have already contacted the owner of my unit and let him know what was up and that he needs to come change my locks.

So, my problem is two part: this must be some sort of negligence/ security issue to have same lock for multiple units and how do I go about get this thief in jail or juvie. I am afraid that he will escalate from petty stealing to something worse. I don't want anyone else caught up in this after I move out. I am already hoping to do a stakeout tonight with my gopro recording as well as sleeping in the living room.

5b60e59cda52255c20d00f27,"Real Estate License Suspension/Revocation Help. My mother is a realtor. Last year she plead guilty to several criminal charges unrelated to real estate, but her other business. She is currently serving in a probation program for 3 years for those crimes.

Now Real Estate Commission is trying to suspend/revoke her license with possible fines, given that she plead guilty to these crimes (demonstrating poor conduct, dishonesty, etc.), and that she failed to notify them within 30 days (she didn't know she had to do this, and sent the info immediately after getting notice). They are requesting admission/denial of allegations, upon which they will determine if there's any validity to the disputes to warrant a trial. If not, there will be a hearing where we can provide witnesses/evidence which will decide the final penalty/sanction. 

Obviously the best scenario is avoiding any trial, and having as minimal penalty/sanction/fines as possible. My mother's previous business closed down, she declared bankruptcy and is 64 years old, so financially she has no money - Being a realtor was how she was making ends meet, so this will be a huge blow. That said, we had a consultation with a lawyer and he's quoting a very high retainer fee and billing rate, which we can barely afford. 

Question is: Is it worth it to call the Commission case office directly, before hiring the lawyer, to get an idea of what the possible penalty/sanctions/fines could be in the first place? The lawyer said if we hired him, the first thing he would do is call the Commission to do exactly this, so we're wondering if we can just ask ourselves? 

Our rationale for this is if the penalty/sanctions/fines are actually not that bad, we can avoid wasting money on a lawyer. [I've read through actual outcomes of real estate license cases ('disciplinary actions') as they're all online, and it seems like for people who committed crimes unrelated to real estate, and are already serving in a probation program, the penalty/sanctions/fines aren't that bad...] On the other hand, we can confirm that the Commission is considering a harsh penalty and high fines, in which case, we can just go ahead and hire a lawyer to help get them reduced. I'd like to know if asking the Commission about this is a good idea or one that could bite us in the ass?

TL;DR - mother is realtor and might have her license suspended/revoked for crimes unrelated to real estate. Fines may also be imposed. Mother has no money (bankrupt) and 64 years old, so losing license will be devastating. At the same time, potential Lawyer is asking for very high fee. Wondering if we can call Real Estate Commission case officer directly to get an idea of possible sanctions and fines the have in mind, and go from there, OR if this is a dumb idea and we should just hire lawyer.

FedEx corporate is now being shady, dragging the ordeal out, and deleting evidence I send them.. A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.

State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.

The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.

Now this is where it gets really shady.
Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.

5b60e59cda52255c20d00fc0,"fast food is upselling illegally?. I've been eating at a particular Carl's Jr restaurant. I am always greeted in the drive-thru with an immediate promotion, which I have to decline politely, before I get a chance to speak and order what I actually want. After my order is taken, the employee will always prompt me with an upsell, ""add a cookie for just a dollar?"" or something similar. However recently I noticed one employee was automatically increasing my combo to a medium, which costs more than the regular small size. At first I let it go. But today I decided to order inside at the counter. I recognized the employee as the same one that took my drive-thru order last time. As soon as I stated which combo I wanted, she automatically reached for the medium-sized soda cup and that's when I had enough. I pushed it back and told her that I didn't ask for medium, to please give me regular size.

I was very annoyed by this type of slimmy sales tactic--I wish I caught it on video (next time I visit, I will record with my mobile). Is this illegal? Can fast-food employees try to slip a fast one on me without first asking if I want the bigger size combo? I can only imagine how many people didn't notice and paid more without knowing, or guys like me who noticed it right away and now have to deal with this pushy sales trick all the time.

 * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment. 
 * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.
 * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.
 * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.

5b60e59cda52255c20d01089,"My terminally ill cousin with schizophrenia was forced out of the hospital. Her siblings are also trying to steal from her [Georgia]. Problem 1:

My cousin has cancer. It was at one point treatable, but because of her mental health issues she was not able follow the plan established by her doctors. She is now terminally ill. Last week (Wednesday, the 44th day of her stay), we were notified by the hospital  that they planned to discharge her the next day. We were generally not happy with the treatment she received there (they would forget to feed her and administer her medication), but the nursing home she came from was worse, and we had yet to find better alternatives.  The next afternoon (Thursday) they returned her to the nursing home after saying she had consented to leave. She has  schizophrenia,  has not consistently received her medication, and is unable to make these kinds of decisions. I, her power of attorney,  did not discuss her discharge with anyone at the hospital (I was unable to return their call in time), and did not consent to her return to this nursing home. After speaking with my cousin about the incident later, she denies saying she was prepared to leave. Friday, around noon, less than 24 hours after she returned to the nursing home, she was readmitted to a different hospital for breathing problems. She was diagnosed with Pneumonia, and doctors noted spots on her lungs. 

We are appalled by the way they have treated her, but aren’t sure who to contact, or what we can do about it. Should we contact the medical board? Do we need a lawyer? What kind of lawyer do we need?

Problem 2:

My cousin has siblings who so far, have not participated in her care, but seem very interested in her assets, and the possibility of acquiring them after her death (she has no children, a nice home, and over $150,000 cash). Though we haven’t mentioned it to her, she has said she suspects they are “only coming around now because they’ve figured out how much money i’ve got”.

One sibling is particularly intent on using her in any way possible. After meeting with her doctor to discuss her prognosis, his first thought was to search her house for life insurance policies. He has asked my husband and I to purchase bonds with her money, and a number of other “small” horrible things. 

This weekend we found out that he broke into her house and changed  her locks. We do not know when it happened, or if he took anything, but my cousin says she did not want him in her house, and did not ask him to change her locks. He says he did so because he needed to find her insurance policy. He doesn’t want to be responsible for her funeral expenses after she passes, and didn’t trust me (the power of attorney) or her other sister to go to her home. He claims to be trying to do what’s best for her. 

He has also been very adamant that she not return to her house (we’ve considered placing her there with an in-home nurse for her final days). We now believe it is because when he was there he stole something. 

I am not sure how to protect her property from him while she is still alive, and I am wondering if I should call the police, and seek a  restraining order.

I went to a new doctor who started me on a prescription for a new medicine to counter some side effects of another medicine I take. The new stuff actually started to help, a lot. For the first time in a long time it didn't feel like my stomach was trying to eat itself constantly. However, they put a typo on the prescription--they prescribed 15 pills at one dosage, and 15 pills at a second, but the second half had the typo and the pharmacy couldn't fill it. No big deal, they have 15 days to correct it, right? Totally wrong. The pharmacy called them 2-3 times in the first week, and faxed the request over as many times. I spent all of the next week calling, leaving voicemails, and never hearing back. Finally Thursday, the pharmacist got a verbal confirmation it was being sent over that day. I called Thursday and got the same confirmation. Nothing. Then Friday morning I called and told them that it needed to be in ASAP so I could pick up that afternoon, because I only had one pill left. They assured me it would be sent to the pharmacy within the hour. 
Pharmacy again got nothing. I tried repeatedly to get through to them again and when I finally got someone on the phone, was told that it was still waiting for the doctor to sign off on it (the girl from the morning had told me she'd messaged the doctor but either she didn't do that, or the doc just didn't bother) and she'd gone home for the day. It's a controlled substance psych med, so the pharmacist wasn't able to even give the one pill to bridge the gap, even though they had the original prescription with that stupid typo.

So today has been an absolutely awful day of being sick, having stomach pains way worse than they were before I started this miracle medicine, and just generally wanting to curl up and cry. 

I'm already looking for another doctor, and gave them honest reviews on Yelp and Google, but honestly with their other low reviews (I didn't even check first, was referred by a friend who didn't have as bad a time) I don't think they care to make improvements. Is there something that can be done to fine them, or somehow bring to their attention how badly they communicate? At this point I just don't want them to screw anyone else over like they did me. 

Thanks everyone, and have a great night.

My wife (Canadian) and I got married in Toronto in May 2016. She insisted that we go live with her wealthy family in the middle east in Jordan after we got married. She was already working for her dad and he wanted to keep her from leaving the office so he promised me work and business opportunity. His promises turned to be flat out lies, I realised after 6 months of working for him that he is not going to pay a cent. Furthermore, my wife demanded an expensive wedding, a whole heap of jewellery and a honeymoon that I paid for (approximately 200K total cost). He had discussed wedding expenses with me when we got engaged and he said that he would help, he also said that he would organise the honeymoon and that it would be a surprise for us. He did nothing and it all turned out to be empty talk. 

After almost 10 months of living with in laws in the middle east in a country where I had no visa, no work permit, and no driver’s license. I had enough so I decided to go back to my home country in New Zealand so that I can go back to work, get out of the middle east and start earning a living again. My wife reluctantly joined me and we have been in NZ for almost 3 months. I started a new job and we are living at my family’s house till we can look at purchasing our own place. I came back from work on Tuesday only to find that all the jewellery is gone, her stuff is gone and she is uncontactable. There were Auckland airport charges on my bank statement on the day that she left. I couldn’t get hold of her but I managed to speak to her dad who told me that she was depressed in NZ and she is on a plane back to Canada. I tried contacting her but she didn’t pick up or return my text messages. I knew she was unhappy here but never expected that she would do something like this. We never had an argument, she didn’t have to do a thing at home as I did the shopping, cooking and laundry. We had a cleaner come in once a week and she just stayed in bed on her laptop watching soaps and going once a week to get her nails done. I never touched or abused her physically or anything like that. 

Our total time together as a married couple was 14 months. We don’t have any kids and its very unlikely that she is pregnant. We mostly lived at her parent’s place and at my parents for a couple of months. I do own a rental property that is rented as an investment and have some money saved in the bank both of these I bought pre marriage. I earned a total of $2000 dollars from working 2 weeks in NZ while I was with her. She never earned a cent as she just used her dad’s credit card to shop while we lived in the middle east. She has an apartment in the middle east that her dad bought for us and put it in her name but we only lived in it for 6 weeks before we left to go to NZ. 

This is where I need your help reddit, I don’t know anything about Canadian law or how it works. However I would appreciate it if you can help please. Do you think she can come after my property here, take away my money or make any other demands? She left me last week and she is not willing to communicate. Even if she was depressed after what she did I don’t think I can ever trust her or get back with her. She is very materialistic, she took all the jewellery even a gold cross that my mum gifted to me when I was 16 for my first communion. For some reason she feels entitled to everything I have yet she never earned a cent as she always worked for her dad. Any suggestions please if there is something I need to do to protect my assets in NZ, I don’t own anything in Canada and I am not a resident or have any immigration status there.

5b60e59cda52255c20d01105,"Help with snowboarding related ticket. Do bench warrants ""expire"" after a certain amount of time?. [TL;DR I have an assumed bench warrant out for my arrest because I failed to show up for an out of state court summons. I was offered a chance to pay a fine after I emailed the Colorado DA but couldn't afford it at the time. Now that I'm wanting to go back to Co, I need to figure out if I even have a bench warrant or anything to pay]

I'm from California and have (had?) a bench warrant out for an unfortunate event that I was ticketed for in Breckenridge, Colorado. I got the the ticket about six years ago and have never taken care of it because I thought I would never be going back to Co.. that is, until a month ago. I was just curious if bench warrants expire after a certain amount of time? I'd like to get this taken care but was curious to know if there'd be anything to even take care of any more. I googled whether or not b.w's expire and I read that after 180 days they fall off, is this true? IF they don't, I'd like to take care of it and was wondering what the best way to do that would be. 

For the backstory: A close friend and I were snowboarding and were riding down a groomed trail when we (stupidly) got the urge to ride down an unmarked section. There was a big gap in the boundary line so we veered off and started down some back country. It wasn't anything insane, just a densely packed forested area with some pretty heavy powder. We ended up going a long way down and basically got stuck as there were no trails or roads at the bottom and going all the way back up in heavy boots was impossible because of how deep the snow was. Finally got a hold of ski patrol who managed to find us from a service road which was literally about 100 feet away.. just couldn't see it from our vantage point (face palm of the century). Shouldn't have happened to begin with though and I certainly learned my lesson.

Ski patrol and police were obviously not very enthused with our decision and we were promptly issued with a summons for a court date set for a few months later. I ended up sending an email to the DA asking if there was anything that could be done so that I didn't have to go all the way back to Colorado and he basically extended an opportunity to just pay a fine (somewhere around $400 I believe). However, I was young and didn't have that kind of money at the time and after a while, just decided to not pay it as I chalked it up to not ever having to go back to Colorado again. Now that I actually want to, I'm worried that I could get arrested on the off-chance I get my id checked. Regardless, I'd like to handle things now that I can afford to pay the fine (if that would still even be an option).

I'm in another state, but he's in California.  We've been friends for decades, often doing business because I trade/sell memorabilia and he buys stuff for his collections.

So I've been getting stuff for him at his request, from various sources that I can't return it to: People on eBay, thrift stores, pawn shops.  Because he's always been honest, I never thought to get a written contract, so I guess you could say we had an oral contract.  (I know; normally I wouldn't be so naive, but as I said, he's been honest for decades.)

Last month, he says he won't be able to buy stuff ""for a while"", however long that would be.  He says he can't pay me because he had a large dental bill, but this is B.S.; his net worth is six figures, so this dental bill is like change he could find in his sofa.  All I was asking was $90 for the stuff he bought, and that included postage (one of the items was really heavy).

I called him to explain that this puts me in a heck of a bind, as I have bills to pay and my money is tied up in this stuff that I can't sell to anyone else.  He collects on these has-been celebrities, you see, so I'm stuck with this junk now.  He said he'd call me back the next day, but half an hour later I get a call from his crooked friend who helps him with his finances.  

The friend says to me, ""He owes you nothing!""  I asked what business is it of his, and sarcastically asked if he has power of attorney over my friend; he lied and said yes, but my friend told me that nobody has power of attorney over him.  I hung up on this liar and tried to call my friend, but he won't take my calls anymore.

I do have a little evidence that we had an agreement for me to sell him stuff every month, such as emails and the USPS insurance/postage receipts.  I could kick myself for not getting this in writing, but I never dreamed this guy would do such a thing.

Do I have any legal recourse against him?  I'm unable to travel to California to take him to small-claims court, and thanks to his actions, I don't have cash to spare, as it's tied up in his junk that he won't pay me back for.

5b60e59cda52255c20d01258,"Neighbors complaint about my service dog barking when we leave him out back. Is he exempted from noise complaints through the ADA? (California). So we've had this dog for nearly 6 months, and an anonymous neighbor has visited our home on 3 separate occasions to complain, and call the police at least once. After the call to the police, animal control stopped by and came to the conclusion that we weren't in violation of any rules at the time (dog was inside, not barking). I noted to the man that he was a service dog, and kind of made it seem like it wouldn't be an issue if she called again, but I just want some clarity of the rules here.

1st appearance/complaint was about mid May. We have footage of her on our Ring doorbell, just knocked then left (we weren't home, hence why the dog was in the back).

2nd complaint (late May/early June), I'm assuming that she does not want to get caught on our Ring doorbell leaving notes on our door, so she left one our garage door, taped, telling us to make our dog stop barking. The animal control visit came shortly after. (We held their instructions, keeping him inside more, since he is crate trained, or I (his owner/handler) take him out more often with me, even if it's not necessary).

3rd complaint/2nd note stuck on garage on 7/9/17. There was a total time of approximately 90 minutes between when he was put outside to when someone came home (Ring doorbell timestamps confirm), and this was enough to warrant another complaint, apparently.

So I guess I just to ask a few things.

1. Are service animals exempt from certain laws since they aren't considered pets (it's not like we leave him from the crack of dawn to middle of the night). Earliest he's been left out is maybe 10-11am, and on ONE occasion, the first complaint, we were at an event a few hours away from home, but he was inside by 9pm, Ring doorbell caught her at the door at about 7pm (daylight still out) 

2. Should/can we take legal action against her (once we find out her identity, she is fond of leaving notes, but no name or number so we can discuss this like adults normally do) for trespassing/leaving unsolicited signs on our home.

It should be noted that I, being disabled, don't leave my home often. The dog has never been left outside for more than 4~ hours at a time. He does split time between the crate and being outside. Maybe the person works evenings, I don't know. I would love to open a dialogue with her, that way we can actually get something done. We were mindful of her complaint to the local PD, even going so far as to getting him anti-anxiety medication, which has helped and there were no issues for a good month or so.

In the end, I'm worried that one of these days, it won't be a note that's left behind, but something more drastic. We know how horrible people can be. It's come to the point where my parents and brother think we now need a camera on the front of the house just to catch her in the act of leaving these childish notes. We didn't keep the first, but have the second and will keep any future ones.


Any help is greatly appreciated. Never had to deal with animal issues before with a neighbor, and I'm totally lost here since I don't know all of the ins and outs of the ADA and how it pertains to this situation.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,0.25

5b60e59cda52255c20d01278,"Pretty bad fight, what can I expect? Help?. Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...

Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.

So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.

Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".

But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.

I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.

I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself.

5b60e59cda52255c20d012c1,"Visitation pick up/drop off. Separated from ex for about four years now. We decided to attempt filing for a non contested divorce without the assistance of an attorney. We agree on everything with the exception of who will drive for pick up and drop off during visitation. We really can't get past this and I think it's probably going to result in a contested divorce in front of a judge. 

A little background; I'm a mother of five children ages 2-10, three are half siblings and step siblings from my current relationship. We alternate holidays and he gets every other weekend with the option to see them whenever he's in the area. Neither of us is too firm on the visutation schedule, we just do whatever works. 

In the four years that we've been sharing custody the kids have never been picked up or dropped off on time. He's picked them up as late as 3am and brought them home as late as 4am on a school night. It's become a huge problem and source of tension. He blames it on my location, says I live too far away but in the four years that we've been separated I've lived in one home while he's lived in several. Whether he's staying with family, friends, in temporary rentals or hotels, I can't be blamed for not consistently living within an appropriate distance from him. 

Currently he lives about an hour and 45 minutes away. He wants to meet halfway for pick up and drop off. Under normal circumstances I would agree that that is fair but I've been there and done that with him. In the beginning I would meet him and we would sit in the car for *hours*, sometimes very late into the night waiting for him to show up. I tried bringing them to his house and still, I would sit for hours, waiting. Eventually I stopped meeting him and now it's becoming an issue of him bringing them back at all because he doesn't want to drive. They'll be due back on Sunday and he'll repeatedly say he's coming but not actually show up until several days later.  It's driving me crazy not having a consistent routine and I realize that something needs to be put down on paper so that everyone is equally liable.

 In a contested divorce will a judge consider the circumstances before ruling on who should do the driving? Honestly the reason I've put this divorce off for so long is that I'm worried a judge will order me to share driving duty and I can't- I just can't- spend every other weekend sitting in a car with my 5 kids waiting on him for hours.",0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.75,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,,0.25
5b60e59cda52255c20d012a8,"Employer Late Paying Wages (NH). Need a little bit of legal advice. The company I was working for has been in the process of paying me back freelancer invoices back when I was under a 1099 a while ago. During that time period I had gone full-time with them and I was receiving a weekly paycheck.

Back in January/December, the company moved from one state to another and the owner was trying to make that change reflect in our taxes that are taken out as New Hampshire's is lower. There were a few pay periods that were missed, but then I resumed getting new ones again and was told that I would be reimbursed for those that I had not received during the transition, along with the original freelance checks. (At this point some of you may be wondering, why didn't you leave or take action at that point or earlier? Well, this industry is notorious for not paying people, but it is also difficult to find a position like the one that I was in, so I felt like it was the best opportunity and the reputation and experience to me at the time was worth it. I was also fresh out of school at the time.)

During my final 2 weeks which was a few months ago, 2 of the checks that they had written to pay me back for the original missed pay periods had bounced. Also, during those 2 weeks I didn't receive an automatic deposit, so I approached my employer about it. They basically said that they had a lot less money to pay me than they thought and that it wasn't fair for me to continue to work there while I wasn't getting paid.

I'm not really privy to the behind the scenes accounting, but I can't imagine they're particularly good at it. My employer wrote up a document to basically say that they were suspending payment for a while and verbally said that they would look to get me paid back within 4 weeks. Verbally, they said that want to bring me back on full-time again once the work picks up. Its been about 2 months, and I have received a replacement check for one of those missed pay periods, but I haven't received word on when I will be expecting more.

Basically, I'm trying to figure out what sort of legal power/ability I have under my control between the freelancer checks, the full-time missed pay periods, the bounced checks, and the sudden suspension of employment even though I was under contract. I'm definitely tired of waiting around and even though I would hate to break off the relationship with this company, money is more important to me at this point. If they are legitimately ""out of money"" I understand that they can only do so much to pay me back, but they lacked the foresight to deal with that preemptively and allowed me to work without receiving payments. I also feel like they are doing what they can to pay me back, as I have received one of the replacement checks, so I'm not sure if that changes anything from a legal perspective.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,,0.75
5b60e59cda52255c20d0132d,"Neighbors [mid 50s-ish] purposefully annoying me [m27] and my wife [f25] with loud music and overheard veiled threats toward us (Ontario, Canada). Note: Posted in r/relationships and r/askto first, someone suggested you'd be a better resource. 

Hey Reddit,

I live in a condo in a town about 45 min north of Toronto, Canada. My neighbors (we share one of those metal walls on our balcony, so sound basically is like it's right beside each other) they were blasting music from about 3pm to 11:07pm on Sunday night, specifically to affect us. I found out from their drunk rants back and forth that they are upset that I sometimes play metal music after work (I've never got a complaint from them before). I'll play music sometimes off my cell phone or off my TV, but they had a very loud sound system blasting oldies rock (van halen, AC/DC, etc) all day, while making jokes like ""hey Rocco think we should play some screamo music instead?"" He'd say ""nah I hate that shit, this is real music"". It's a man and woman, probably at least late 50s, my wife and I are mid 20's. (and Disturbed/System of a Down/ Otep is the music I think they're complaining about, certainly not screamo!) 

Eventually we complained to security twice, they only answered the door to security for the first complaint, which I made on my way out of the building for a rec league sport I play downtown. My wife ended up feeling unsafe as she heard them after the complaint ""they don't know who they just fucked with, they'll regret this"", ""I'll fuck them up every chance I get"", ""we'll complain to security about every little thing they do now"", etc - those were all told to the security guard and added to their file (whatever that entails). 

While I was out my wife went down to complain the second time, the male neighbor walked out of the parking garage, visibly intoxicated, was most likely driving just before that. He saw my wife making the complaint, both her and the security guard noticed that he almost fell over he was so drunk. I probably would have called the cops right then if I had seen that but neither of them did, pretty sure it's too late now. 

According to my wife they then made more veiled threats to us talking with each other, my wife got scared and called me and I left my game early to come home. Neighbors continued drinking and playing music until 11:07pm, their son came out at around 10:30 and told them they should be careful because 11pm (official noise complaint time) was coming up, they just laughed at him (I'm guessing he's around 15ish, and I hear him smoking bongs on the balcony pretty often). He came out at another point and asked if they had any batteries and they just laughed at him and said ""what do you think we are, the dollar store?"" - obviously they're not the best parents and really drunk. 

I took recordings with my phone of the loud music and backed them all up on iCloud. Even in the bathroom on the opposite side of the unit (950 sq ft), with my cellphone music at full blast and the fan on I could hear deep bass. Security entered our unit both times (at my wife's request) and noted the loud volume we could hear inside.

These neighbors are in at least their late 50s, maybe older. They don't seem to work at all, sound like they're straight out of Sunnyvale trailer park and best friends with Jim Lahey, they really just drink and smoke cigarettes all day. They and I smoke cigarettes so we're outside often at the same times (I've never talked to them before, I don't even know what they look like, but wife does). They rent, we own. Security guard told my wife that they and their landlord will be sent a complaint letter. 

I'm worried that they'll cause more problems in the future, especially if I have music on that they can hear, it's the summer and I like to have the windows open and some music on for like half an hour when I get home from work most days, but I don't even own a stereo that could play music at even half the volume they had theirs on at today. I'll likely stop that or at least cut this back now. 

Any suggestions? I'll call the cops if I need to (if this persists) but I really don't want to cause even more issues, these people sound like really vengeful children. I found the website for Toronto bylaw and it says noises at anytime, not just after 11pm that effect ""quiet enjoyment of a home"" can be grounds for a cop call, but 
a) we're in a nearby town and I'm not sure if the bylaw is the same (couldn't find that online) and 
b) we like to make noise too, we have the occasional party or times with loud music (but not as loud) - difference is if we get a complaint we've turned it down and apologized, not turn it up and make threats and loudly complain all day (only got one noise complaint in this building from a different neighbor and did exactly that, but have got some at past residences and did the same)

Any ideas Reddit?

5b60e59cda52255c20d012d8,"[TURKEY, USA CA]Newegg took my money to pay customs duties, import and sales taxes on my behalf but failed to do so, I'm getting charged for custom fees again.. I live in Turkey, I have ordered around 1860$(with taxes and shipment) worth of computer parts from newegg.com/global/tr.

**TLDR;** At https://www.newegg.com/global/ page they say ""During the order checkout process, Newegg will calculate and display the order total amount along with cost of customs duties and applicable import and sales tax (VAT/GST). Should you elect to proceed with completing the purchase, all orders will be delivered with duty and tax fully paid for and included in your final checkout price."" and at https://kb.newegg.com/Article/Index/12/3?id=1400 page ""When Newegg products are shipped to eligible countries, an estimate of the estimated VAT/GST &amp; Duty will be levied on the items in your order for shipment to countries outside of the U.S. With your authorization, these funds are used by the carrier or another agent to pay the Import Fees on your behalf (or the recipient's behalf) to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The payment of import fees is the responsibility of the importer and is levied based on the laws of the country into which the products are being shipped."" on the same page it also says ""You won't be charged additional fees if the actual Import Fees exceed the VAT/GST &amp; Duty we estimated."" and Turkey is listed as one of the eligible countries, yet, they are refusing to cover the fee on my behalf. 

I know some of my options here:

* I can pay the customs fee again get the items then keep chasing after the money I paid for tax &amp;/or duty using chat with us or charge back through bank; i can consider doing this because I have ordered some other parts from other places which I have received already, If I can't receive my order from newegg, I'm gonna have to return them too. But If I do this and the items I receive require some RMA than I will get screwed.

* I can forget about the items,  go for a full charge back through bank since newegg failed to deliver my items as they have promised me; the catch here is items are stuck at customs and they may claim they have done their part, and I can't even send the items back to them because FedEx Turkiye asking me more than 200$ to return the shipper. At that point paying the customs fee makes more sense.

Do I have any other options beside these and how should I proceed?


Back story; 

At 07/03/2017 my package arrived at Turkey and delayed at customs and i have been reaching out to them through ""Chat With Us"" since. At my first contact with 2278378 chat session number, I have been told that I don't have to pay any fees by rep Cassie L. Later I got an e-mail from a customs broker regarding the necessary paperwork for customs and the amount of fees levied on my items. I have provided the paperwork and contacted newegg about the fees in chat session 2284660. Rep Joanne Z. asked me to forward the e-mail I got from the broker, which I did, and told me their shipping team will check it out.

After 24 hours from my last contact with them, my package was still delayed at customs so I contacted them to ask why is this taking this long, this was suppose to be an express shipping after all, I knew customs delays are not their fault but they were doing nothing to speed things up and I didn't wanna wait weekend out. 

At chat session 2287615 things got a complete turn and I have been told by rep Nick W. that they will not cover my custom fees. I refused to pay that I have already paid and told him I will file a charge back through my bank because they have failed to deliver my items as they promised. Nick W. said a charge back will only cause more issues which I felt like a threat. 

I ended that chat session but shortly after decided to give it another try by asking them to charge me back the amount as I paid to them to cover the customs duties, import and sales taxes on my behalf in chat session 2287646. Rep Olivia F. asked me to contact with FedEx(since they are the carrier company), I refused to do that by saying newegg is the one who has a deal with FedEx, they are the FedEx's customer not me but tried it anyway, fedex.com told me to contact FedEx Turkey, but FedEx Turkey never answered my e-mails. 

In that chat session (2287646) Olivia F. also said that ""The tax amount shown during checkout is an estimate. If it is not enough, you need to pay for the left"" which is the exact opposite of what their webpage says. When I reminded her what it says on their website she also said ""It(custom fee) will not be charged by us, but we cannot guarantee the shipping carrier will charge the tax or not."" Again i'm not the customer of FedEx, they cannot charge me and I haven't been inform about this.

Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:

- The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.

- It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective

- This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.

- I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains.

I sell various products, and I work hard to position them as high in the search results as possible.  I've been working on some products for months or years, and they slowly gain position in the search pages leading to more sales - but it takes time.  Lots of time.

Recently a competitor started selling a similar product.  (When I say ""similar"" I really mean ""exactly the same"", but with their label on it.  Which is fine, that happens all the time.)  The problem is that this seller generated dozens of completely fake five star reviews, getting his product in the top 10 search results within a week. That's right.  On exceptionally high-volume search results, he got to the top 10 in a week. 

The reviews are obviously fake.  The people leaving the reviews have never reviewed any other product except for this guys.  They all left over-the-top, gushing reviews about how the freaking product ""changed their life.""  Each left pictures and videos.  Me and a friend traced back all of the accounts, and believe we mapped out a pretty decent network of sellers that work together creating fake accounts and leaving fake reviews.  The evidence is strong.

This practice is in direct violation of Amazons terms, but they don't seem to have any interest in enforcing their own rules.

I met with an escort at a hotel she was residing in. I went to her room and she met me in a towel, as I requested, and then she kissed me following me entering the room. She asked for her money and I told her I had none. She then proceeded to kick me out. As I was driving away she texted me my licence plate and told me she would call the police. I told her I would contact the hotel she was staying in and she told me to kiss goodbye to my car.

Any legal advice?

Extra Info:
I texted her the day before asking for a 30min meet. I intended to meet her at this point. In the morning she didnt reply and I assumed it was off, it was only an hour before she confirmed. I requested a certain outfit from her but I didn't intend to carry out any services because I felt I was doing something wrong, so I brought no money. I do not know what brought me to her residence.

5b60e59cda52255c20d014f8,"What can I do regarding a contractor who will not repair the roof to my deck?. LOCATION: WEST VIRGINIA

So this contractor builds me a deck with a simple shed roof over part of it. This was completed in February. Everything looked fine. I paid him and we were happy.

Then the first big rain of the season comes and the roof leaked horribly. Multiple spots, dripping, pouring in other places.

I contacted him and he came back out, looked at it, and applied a fix to the roof. This was done at no cost to me (as I expected it to be).

During the next rain, the roof still leaked albeit less than it did before, but still, I had drips on both sides of the door leading to the deck and soaking spots in a few places.

I contacted him about that and I was told I should contact a roofer to get it repaired.

This is where the problems started. I told him that his company built the roof and I expect his company to take care of it. He told me he would get someone he knew from a local roofing company to come out and assess it.

I have no proof that this ever occurred only his word.

Another month passes.

I contact him almost every week to ask where we are on this.

Finally, he tells me the roofer has come out and looked at the roof and knows what to do to fix it.

Great! Then nothing.

Another month passes.

I contact him and now they are waiting for a cost of materials, etc. He says he hasn't forgotten about me and he was waiting for responses from a 3rd party roofer.

Another month passes.

I sent him a message last week. It goes unanswered. I sent him a message this morning and so far nothing.

I am considering taking him to court over this, but I don't know if that's the correct thing to do. I have all my texts to him, I have all the pictures I've taken of the leaks.

I just want a roof that doesn't leak and I feel it's his responsibility to fix it. I also feel like I shouldn't be charged for anything in this matter. And as far as the contract goes, he brought it up a few times saying this is out of scope of the contract and I disagree. I feel that a working roof is very much in scope of the contract and since this roof doesn't work then does that constitute a breach? 

Am I screwed because we paid him in full when the work was done? If it didn't rains as much as it did, we wouldn't have even known there was a problem.

What I am seeking by taking him to court is either money so I can find someone else to fix his faulty roof or a court order telling him he has x amount of time to fix it and fix it right or he will also have to pay me money to get it fixed.

I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.

He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.

I posted here a few days ago asking about this but deleted it (I know we're not supposed to do that now, my apologies.)

(NYC) We saw an apartment with a broker from a big rental company, signed a fee agreement stating that in the event that we rent an apartment in that building we owe the company the commission fee. We almost signed with them but they would not wait over the weekend for our guarantor paperwork even though we had put down a deposit. We backed out and went to look elsewhere. We found a new broker who showed us a few places we didn't like and then he tried to show us one at the building where tried to apply to before. We got excited, applied, and got the apartment. 

Now the original broker is coming at us for the fee which we thought we were going to have to pay. We did however find out that they do not work with the same company anymore and is asking us to make a check payable to this new real estate company. In the fee agreement, it explicitly states that we are only to make the commission payable to the company that showed us the building. Not to the name of the broker, broker, and certainly not a whole new company. After seeing this we decided to contact a lawyer who believes that that is illegal and we only have to pay if the original company comes after us.

The broker is not contacting me from any company and is instead sending me text messages directly. When I mentioned that we will not be making a check out to the new company they are requesting or them personally, the broker got upset and is now threatening legal action again. Basically saying that we have to pay the new company so they can process it through the old one.

This all sounds extremely fishy and again, nowhere in the one fee agreement that we signed does it say anything about a new company, the broker receiving the fee, or any transfers between companies. The only issue is the original company no longer has that building under it's listings and it looks like the broker took the building over to their new company.

We are contacting the lawayer again today but I was wondering if this all sounds like bluffing because to my untrained legal mind, we would've had to sign something saying that the fee can transfer companies before paying a whole separate entity instead of who it says to pay in our agreement.

Apologies if the answer is clear, I've done a bunch of research and couldn't find the answer from a definitively reputable source. 

My question is: If I take a lifeguard course/certification just so i'm more prepared if the need arose for my family/friends, is there any increased liability if there was an issue while attempting to save family/friends/strangers since there is a certification attached?

While one might quickly say no, a similar situation to consider would be getting one's boat captain license. Even if you're piloting a boat for friends for fun, you become legally liable for their safety as a _professional captain_ since you're licensed whether or not you're on-duty/getting paid. 

Maybe the safest thing liability-wise to do would be to take the course without attempting certification?

I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options.

Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.

I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.

My wife and I have two very young children (both under the age of 2) who are babysat and adored by family friends who are about our age. They love our kids almost as much as we do. We're trying to make plans for the future, including a will, and want the family friends to raise the kids if something happens to us. They have accepted (tears of joy were involved), and we just need to figure out the legal path.

The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.

After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.

After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options: 
-Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher 
-40% off a new Bosch replacement.

I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?

The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.

What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this?

However, before I actually started, we found out the Assistant Manager was going to be gone for the summer. I was then told that I would be promoted to Assistant Manager for the summer. With this job, the base pay is usually $14.00, but with my experience I could expect around $14.50-15.00.

5b60e59cda52255c20d01bb3,"TN. Realtors are trying to take ~$48k of my mom's money.. Throw away account used as precautionary measure.

**Short version**

Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.

**Long version**

My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have. 

Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.

When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.

There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.

The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.

The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.

This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.

I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.

Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.

Did some searching through previous posts but couldn't find an exact case related to mine. Here's a bit of backstory -

Was walking our dog in a wooded area yesterday (Sunday, 7/10). Upon meeting another guy with his dog, our animals got into a scuffle. My leg ended up in the middle of it, with the other dog taking a bit ol' honking bite into my calf. Got the guy's information and gave him ours, then went straight to the hospital where I received a single stitch and some antibiotics. I forwent a tetanus shot (had a booster last year) and the rabies shot *for now*. I am currently in a health insurance coverage gap because I just returned to the states from a year working abroad (great timing, right?).

Here's what I and my family have done so far - 

* Requested the vaccination and medical records of the dog that bit me.

* Provided our dog's owner information to the other dog's owner for the town's animal control officer.

* Filed a dog bite incident report to the town where the bite occurred.

* Started looking around for a personal injury attorney willing to provide advice.

I've held off on filing a police report for the time being, because the other owner has been extremely cooperative and communicative throughout the whole ordeal.

At this point I'm just looking to see if there's anything I missed or what someone like myself should do in this case, beyond lawyering up.

So basically the only singed paperwork I have from him expired in 2013, and we had verbal agreements to one year extensions up until now.  He is also notorious for skimming emails and his low reading comprehension skills have led to some interesting confusion in the past.

This year, my girlfriend and I decided to move in together.  Because her lease ended earlier than mine, we singed a lease on a new apartment starting July 1.  However, we decided that I should move in in August to make things a little less hectic.  When I asked my landlord for a reference, I clearly stated that despite my new lease starting a month early, I was planning on staying through the end of my current lease at the end of August, but that I was willing to move a little out earlier if he wanted me to.  I scheduled movers to come on August 5, and emailed my landlord that that was my move-out date, and told him in person when I saw him the next day.  A week later in early June, my landlord listed my apartment on Craigslist as available on August 1.  I sent my landlord two e-mails reminding him that we had agreed I would not be moving out of my apartment until August 5.  He replied saying that he had a tenant lined up for an August 15 move-in.  I confirmed this with him verbally the next day. 

I heard nothing else about my move for a month, until today when he emailed me to schedule the move-out inspection because he needed the apartment ready by 7/14.  I haven't even started packing yet as I assumed I had another month and I was helping my girlfriend pack her stuff.  There is no way I can have my stuff out of here in four days.

My question is, if my landlord did in fact sign a lease with a new tenant starting July 15, where does that leave me? I only have a verbal agreement for my current lease.  My landlord has stated that he treats them as one-year extensions, but legally I wouldn't be surprised if it was considered month-to-month. I notified my landlord five times that I was moving out in the beginning of August, three times in writing.  I also have his written agreement that he was leasing the apartment for August 15, and well as a verbal agreement.  I double checked his email, and he spelled out the date as August 15 instead of 8/15.  Can he really give me four days notice that his last communication with me was a typo?",0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25

My parents are currently having a problem, and I was wondering if there is any legal recourse.

There are several trees that are on my neighbors property. A significant part of each tree overhanged onto my property, and the trees both provided significant privacy and shaded the property for most of the day. The power company came yesterday and cut down those trees completely. We now have the lovely view of the trailer park behind my house, without so much as a bush in between us. Additionally, my parents are concerned that their property value (and they're trying to sell) is going to go down, because you can now see the aforementioned trailer park quite clearly, and there's much less privacy and shade on our property.

A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results. 

2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.  

After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.

Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.

He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..

He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.

so rewind to about a year ago when I began taking some medicine to remove a foot fungus in the. During one of my last treatment visits in January 2017, I saw a different podiatrist for the first time due to my other podiatrist being out of the office. This new podiatrist may have had an issue with my appearance or something because he did not really address me at all and seemed annoyed by my presence. He did not talk much even though I had asked him a lot of questions about my progress. He takes a quick look at my nails and then proceeded to cut my nails very low, despite my painful cries, without warning me or asking me to do so in the first place. After which he writes me a script for some bogus prescription that didn't help and left without saying anything. Fast forward to May 2017, and I start to develop very uncomfortable pain in one of the toes trimmed down low. Apparently, the low cutting of the toenail resulted in an ingrown toe nail in eventually both toes. A preventative measure to this is to soak your foot in salt water to help the nail grow, but my previous podiatrist did not mention anything about that. 

The ingrown toenail proceeded to get infected, and resulted in the last couple of months of alot of pain, discomfort, expenses on medical supplies, and many trips to the doctor. I really find this podiatrist culpable of all of these issues, especially since the other podiatrist I saw before him did not think it was necessary to cut the nail so low, and has been coaching me through the entire process.

Can I sue that podiatrist I saw in Jan for cutting my nail too low and not giving me any advice after to prevent ingrown toenails?  Are their lawyers out there willing to see this case considering there won't be a lot of money involved?

5b60e59cda52255c20d01e92,"[Florida] Officer at my door with papers twice today, what could they want?. Late Saturday night my downstairs neighbors called the police on my husband and I for arguing (the walls are thin here), we did not answer the door because the neighbors call the cops constantly over the most minor things like doing dishes, watching tv, walking around at night and so on, every time we HAVE answered the door in the past the officers simply tell us they got an anonymous complaint for noise, and that they couldn't hear anything, then they leave.  We stopped answering the door quite a while ago, because it's just an annoyance.  However when the police officers arrived Saturday night they MIGHT have heard my husband raising his voice, but we weren't in need of any sort of police assistance, it was just an argument, so we did not answer the door.

Anyway, today (Monday) I got a knock on my door in the morning while I was still in bed, then again at 6:00 PM, both times an officer not in uniform, but with a badge, had a clipboard with paperwork. The 2nd time I did try to answer the door but the officer was already leaving.

My question is this, what could they possibly want?  Could this be related to blatantly not answering the door on Saturday night over a noise complaint?  Or is this possibly a subpoena they are trying to serve on an unrelated case (last year someone attacked me and destroyed some of my property and he's still going through pre-trials)

5b60e59cda52255c20d01fae,"[US] Discrimination victim lost suit, ordered to pay ""minimal"" legal fees as a result. How to negotiate?. I was the victim of a discrimination suit several years ago in the US. Due to the organization being so high profile they were able to shut down the case in summary judgement and spread misinformation (the judges admitted that they didn't understand the nuances of the case, and had very strong ties to organization in question).

I don't understand it 100% but I was told that I would be responsible for some legal fees if I lost. They tried to cut a deal with me by asking me not to appeal the case and then they wouldn't charge it but I appealed anyway. From what I understand the fees are capped to bare basics like filing fees etc so I wouldn't be responsible for something like 200k+ but more like 700-800 dollars. This is a drop in the bucket for them but very costly for me.

I understand that I am legally responsible for these fees, however as a direct result of this case and the emotional trauma I suffered at the hands of this organization, I lost that job, became almost unemployable due to Googling my name shows this failed court case, had to move in with family because I was desperate to have somewhere to live, had to flee that situation because of domestic abuse at the hands of my family, and have been homeless since the beginning of the year. For some reason they are deciding to try to contact me regarding those fees now of all times when I am literally homeless.

This has really reopened my trauma and I think it's deeply inappropriate for them to try to do this at this time especially when they had a part in creating this situation. I understand that legally I promised to pay those fees. I wanted to ask a) can I appeal to a judge about my situation or did I already promise all that time ago? and b) can I tell them that I will go public with this story and create negative PR for them if they decide to move forward?

This whole time I went the legal route instead of the press route because I didn't want to be in the spotlight but I wonder if things would have turned out differently because there would have been pressure for them to be held accountable. If they are choosing to really push to get those fees after all this time when I have hit rock bottom I don't see why I shouldn't reveal what they are doing to the press.

Also please be kind with this post and don't put down and disrespect my situation or my trauma. I understand this is just one side of the story but please take it at face value without judging or victim blaming. I have been through a lot with this and I will report and flag comments that are cruel and unhelpful.

I'll note here that moving any senior into a retirement home with more care requires them take a physical within 30 days of moving and they must have all medical records.

I was helping my grandparents organize their finances and 1 item that stuck out was that my grandmother has a credit card exclusively in her name with a balance of about $5K. She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.

I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).

Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail?

Or rather, the guy SAID he was from Comcast, but he wasn't wearing a uniform or anything to identify him with Comcast, and his truck was unmarked. He didn't have an ID badge or anything. My boyfriend freaked out and told the guy to get out. 

Our property manager left a note on our door on July 6 saying that Comcast services would be coming by on July 7. We were concerned about a tech being in our apartment unsupervised while we were both at work, so the manager said she would have the maintenance guy oversee the service call. We were still apprehensive, but we know the maintenance manager and trust him, so we thought it would be fine. 

July 7 came and went. We came home from work and hadn't seen any Comcast person. We didn't know if anyone had come or not. Our management, as you can see, is terrible about communication. 

Note: we did not request Comcast to come out. We already have our internet service all set up with Comcast--this is our complex's service setup.

I bought a house in June, so I wanted to move out of my apartment. However, my lease contract did not have an early termination fee (I found out that Texas laws are terrible for renters).

So I decided to try subleasing my apartment, announcing it on craigslist. I was offering good incentives to whoever decided to move in, hoping to find someone as soon as possible.

Apparently, the only legal way to sublease the apartment was to remain in the contract and add the new renter as a roommate.

l felt safe since I knew that the apartments always do a background check before accepting someone.

Several people asked about the apartment, but the one that finally accepted my offer was a woman named Ivy Lee Cruz. Some things on her profile were weird, but in the end, she passed the background check and things looked ok.

On July, I got a call from the apartments. They told me that Ivy had rented the apartment to two other guys and that she did not live there anymore
(I visited her before and I am sure she was living there in June). She was not answering her phone and she had not paid July's rent. At that point, I tried contacting her at her job and they told me that she never worked there.

I had to pay for the rent, late fees, insurance, etc.
The guys that were renting the apartment from her were asked to move out immediately and they also lost a lot of money (from rent and deposit).

The worst part is that the apartment complex is not giving me any information to help me locate her or even sue her and they won't take any action since I am paying the rent. They also say that I cannot search for another person to rent the apartment since I would need her signature! So my only option is to pay a reletting fee and the monthly rent until the apartment is rented.

Do you have any idea about how to proceed in this case? How can I get the apartments to help me?

So, I have been on the run from my debts for about 10 years.  Most of my debt has fallen off of my credit report, but I have a lot of money (for me...I would guess about $15-20K) still owed on these accounts that are no longer on my credit report and sold to various collection agencies.  I have moved multiple times and avoided requesting credit unless absolutely necessary (utilities, etc) to try and fall off the collection radar.  I never intended on getting credit again or buying a house, was young, and needless to say lacking foresight.

Now, it's 10 years since I ran from my debt, I have been married a few years to a woman who had a mortgage already.  We applied for a credit card 3 years ago and got approved.  It makes me nervous to have credit, and we have already managed to get ourselves into 4k worth of debt in just a few years.  We collectively also owe about 3K to the IRS we are paying off in installments as a result of our witholding being wrong for a few years but not being able to afford to correct the error.  We are no longer being undertaxed so we should work out closer to 0 this year and not go further into debt to the IRS.

My wife would like to look at selling our house and moving closer to work, but we don't qualify for good interest rates unless my income is included, but I have dings on my credit report and I don't end up helping.  I am nervous because I feel once I get assets on paper, someone might get the idea to accumulate my debt and sue me for the full amount once I have something worth taking like a house.  As of now, the house is in my wife's name.

Bottom line, what is my recourse for these old debts?  How should I go about getting them taken care of?  Is bankruptcy an option, can I do it individually, or would I take my wife down with me?

I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ? 

My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?

5b60e59cda52255c20d020c2,"I want to sue the psych department at a hospital for malpractice. Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.

 As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her. 

I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked. 

When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me. 

Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes. 

and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record. 

There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.

5b60e59cda52255c20d0206f,"Apartments Ransom. Howdy folks, So a little over 4 months ago we decided to move out of our apartment. Unknown to us this complex required 60 days written notice before moving out. Ive only ever been required 1 months notice so this was unexpected. We failed to provide written notice which would have made our move out day concurrent with the end of our scheduled lease and ended up incurring month-to-month fees. Because of this I made a serious point to deliver written notice the next Monday. 

We have since signed a lease at another complex set to commence at the end of this month but are now being told by our current complex that they do not have a written notice on file for us, meaning they expect us to charge us full rent plus additional month-to-month fees (totaling around $3200). 

We will not have the financial ability to pay this total on top of our newly acquired rent. I have communicated this to the apartment management and was told I would receive a phone call to give me a final answer from the ownership. Have not heard from anyone yet. We went to the office today to try and get an answer but basically got told they aren't sure how to proceed, which I take to mean ""you'll find out at the first of the month."" which sounds like I'm about to be very hungry for the next 3 months. 

Basically I am wondering what options I have as far as fighting this? I have a 3 year old lab mix and he doesn't deserve to suffer because our apartment is unorganized. He's a good boy.

5b60e59cda52255c20d02051,"Got fired for refusing to work with someone who kept calling me a gringo.. I worked as a crew leader for a landscaping company in NV off and on for two years. Last Wednesday I was sent to work with another crew because they where short on people due to two or three people quitting the week prior. I had worked with this crew a few times before and due to them being short on people and hadn't had any major issues other than that I was made to do a majority of the work while they where often either just standing around talking or nowhere to be found. There was one individual who I could tell didn't like me from the first time I met him and I could tell it was a racial thing(he was Hispanic and while I have native blood in me I'm usually assumed by others to be white). In a job like landscaping you have to have thick skin, it's all dudes and it's all outside manual labor. I can put up with a lot, and for a while I did. Now I don't speak Spanish, but it's not hard to figure out when I hear the word gringo while they are talking, then immediately after tell me to go do something(I was often the only ""white guy"") that it was the old ""make the gringo do it"". Fast forward to last week. I've been sent to work with them again the prior day I had worked and this day they made me go dump my trailer then meet them up there. I get up there and drive around looking for them at their normal work areas for a while, then finally find them. First thing the individual asks me is what took me so fucking long. I told him I had been driving around looking for them to which he huffed, put his truck into gear and said ""fucking gringo"" as he started to drive off. This behavior continued through the day until around lunch, when this crew simply disappears. I've been sent to help them and they just leave without telling me where they are going. So I waste a good amount of time driving around looking for them and I finally find them and start working(me and another co-worker who had been sent up there with them(also a white guy)). We went back to doing what we where doing before lunch and at some point they just left us again, without any word. At this point I've had enough and I decide we would just work on our own and I would talk to my boss about it at the end of the day. About 20-30 minutes into working by boss pulls up and starts yelling at both of us not to work so close together because we ""look like butt buddies"". He then tells us that we need to go help the other crew or we will be fired. I started to tell him that I refuse to continue working with that crew and to continue being called a gringo when he cuts me off and threatens that if I don't go back to work with them he would fire me. I told him ""well you can fire me"" to which he replied ""fine"" then asked me for the keys to my truck. He then preceded to force the other co-worker to go back and work with the other crew and left me stranded in another town. 
The day following I was told that I needed to sign some price of paper when I went to pick up my check. This paper stated that I had quit and that my ""final pay had been explained to me"" even though I was yet to receive my final pay(the check I was picking up was for the week prior)

I have tried to contact the companies HR(they are a huge company) and was told they don't even have an HR. I've contacted the Nevada equal rights commission and filed a report with them and am currently waiting for word back from a lawyer. Until then I was hoping for some guidance as to what else should be done. Is there a better agency to contact than the Nevada equal rights commission?

5b60e59cda52255c20d0207f,"Is this medical billing/collections/insurance fraud?. Last year, I went in to a California urgent care center because I ended up having strep throat. I gave them my Aetna PPO insurance, paid the $75 copay, and then went on my merry way to the pharmacy. This was about a year ago.

I did a credit report check recently, and to my surprise a $200 bill had been placed into collections over 6 months ago, with the urgent care center listed as the original account holder. So I call this urgent care, which is located in a small shopping mall and is not attached to a hospital or any other medical offices. The receptionist pulls up my account and tells me that she sees that I paid the copay, but that they have nothing to do with further billing, as they send all their claims to a contracted medical billing office for insurance collection, which is apparently the standard in the industry. She kindly gives me their medical billing company's phone number, apologizes, and says she has ""not heard positive things"" about them. Great.

So I call the medical billing office explaining that their buddy, the urgent care center, sent me to them with my qualms about this phantom $200 medical bill. She looked me up by my name and birthday, and said that yes, they did send that amount to Stanislaus Credit Control Agency after four unsuccessful attempts to contact me. Interestingly enough, the main offices for both Stanislaus and this medical billing company are both located in Modesto, CA. Anyway, the lady says this is a result of me not reaching my insurance deductible, and that this $200 was the amount my insurance, Aetna, would not cover for the urgent care visit. I thought that sounded legitimate so I eased my tone and said thanks for clearing that up.

However, I now believe she was giving me a pre-scripted run-around. I call Aetna to ask what my deductible would be for an urgent care visit. **Aetna says there is no deductible for urgent care visits, only a copay.** I ask them to look up the claim for this urgent care visit, as the urgent care center has my Aetna insurance policy on file. **Aetna has no record of any claim for any urgent care center on my behalf.** 

My Aetna customer service guy says hold on, he will personally call this medical billing office. I stay on the line listening to the provided elevator music, and he comes back reporting that the person who is in control of my account is apparently not in the office today, a Monday afternoon at 2pm. I ask my Aetna customer service guy if he thinks that sounds shady. He agrees, and says he personally will try again tomorrow and get back to me. I google the urgent care center on Google, and there are already four negative reviews mentioning surprise letters from collections agencies.

I (stupidly) paid $520.00 as a partial payment.


On May 19th, I get a call from someone identifying himself as a dispatcher, saying they will be picking up my stuff on the 20th in the afternoon and will call me before they come. The 20th comes and goes with no call until 10:30pm at night saying they will be there in the morning of the 21st.

I called Company A and told them what happened and that I wanted my $520 back. They told me they would call me back. Unsurprisingly, they never returned by call, my multiple messages, or my emails and even stoped answering my calls. 


I disputed the charge with BOA a few days after the 20th of May. I was notified today that they are closing the claim and not returning my money.

Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage. 

Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,

The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.

When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.

The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife.

So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through.

5b60e59cda52255c20d02149,"[US(/Japan?)] Film Contest Rights/IP Grab Fine Print?. Hi folks,

I was excited to see that Ryuichi Sakamoto is having a short film contest where you make a short film that utilizes songs from his new album, and three winners get money, compositions to use in future films, filmmaking advisor services, a spot on the blu-ray version of the album, among other things.

But in the submission guidelines, there is this bullet point:

&gt;Upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the submitted work in any media form for any purpose. **Our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, adapt, transmit, demonstrate, create derivative work, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion.** Furthermore, upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company and any affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the name(s), nick name(s), and biography of the filmmaker in any media form for any purpose. Our Company, affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, transmit, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion. The intended use includes but is not limited to the uploading to various websites and social media channels including Ryuichi Sakamoto’s official website, his social media channels, the official website and YouTube/Vimeo channels of the Japanese label commmons and the official website and YouTube/Vimeo channels of the international label Milan Records, in addition to the promotional use of the short film for async and as a preview for the documentary film, “Ryuichi Sakamoto Documentary Project” (tentative title).  The filmmaker must represent and warrant the lack of a third party contract which may interfere with the licensed rights above.

Is this (especially what I bolded) as sinister as it sounds? A mere submission means that a third party can create derivative work based on submitted work? ""Sorry, you lost, so we don't have to pay you, but we can spin your idea into a feature film or music video of our own production at any time.""

Am I misreading this and it's actually standard? Or it's standard anyway? Or it's an overzealous lawyer just covering themselves in case someone wins and then sees a better offer elsewhere? Er, covering themselves in case they happen to make something similar to a generic submission in the future so no one can try to pull a Creed situation?

5b60e59cda52255c20d02111,"[MI, USA] Adult friend's mother is claiming to have paperwork proving legal guardianship over her. For context, my friend turned 18 at the end of October 2016. This drama didn't begin until well after that, around March 2017. 

Her mother and step-father are not nice people, nor are they particularly intelligent (I'm putting this very, *very* lightly). For years, she's been told by doctors that she has both depression and anxiety (unmedicated until a couple weeks ago), but due to religious reasons/political differences, her mother insisted she be tested for autism. So she was, and the results came back saying that she has provisional aspergers; this means that she showed some symptoms, but those could just be byproducts of her unmedicated depression/anxiety combo. Her mother does not seem to grasp this at all, and insists that she 100% has autism, treating her as if she's a young child. 

During a certain event a month ago (far too long to explain here, as it goes too far off topic), police were intervening, and her mother was howling about how she had paperwork proving that my friend cannot make her own decisions (we were trying to pick her up to take her to a comedy show), so she cannot decide to leave with her friends, and threatened to press charges on us for attempted kidnapping. She merely showed the cops the paper that diagnosed my friend with provisional aspergers and the cops had her go home with her parents, no other arguments permitted. 

However, after chatting with someone this week whose parents/younger brother have actually gone through the process of gaining legal guardianship over someone 18+ years old, it came to my attention that her mother might be lying, or that she's forged some documents. We're not sure. I've done some light digging (some of which was very confusing to read), and it seems that, on the basic level, certain paperwork needed to be submitted, court dates needed to be set up/attended, and above all else, my friend should have been informed that all of this was happening (if it actually was). She received no notice whatsoever of anything like this. 

So my big question here is: Is it AT ALL possible that her mother was able to sneakily obtain the legal stuff necessary with ZERO consent or knowledge from my friend, since she is not a minor? (And a second less pressing question, which you can ignore if you want since it's not the main focus: Are there any important things we should keep in mind if her mother presses this further, or if there's a confrontation over it?)",0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.26666666666666666,0.75,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25

My husband is combining separate components of two 85 Honda Nighthawk 650s to make the best of the two bikes. Bike A's engine seized, but is otherwise in great condition for an 85. Bike B has an engine in excellent mechanical shape, but the forks need swapped, the gas tank is dented, etc. 

There is a slight concern that we have. Bike B's gauge cluster is busted and the speedometer doesn't work. Bike A's gauge cluster is cosmetically and functionally the better part. The issue is that Bike A only has 15k miles, while bike B has 26k miles. If we put A's cluster on B's frame, it would show 11k miles less than are actually on the frame and engine. 

What is the correct way to proceed? Should we swap the odometers and disclose to the DMV that the mileage is incorrect? Should we crack open the gauge cluster and roll it to the correct mileage? Should we just forget about swapping the cluster entirely? We're trying to be as honest as we can with the bike.

5b60e59cda52255c20d021ab,"[Ohio] Software side project gone bad, client demanding money paid to me as a 1099 employee be returned in full or lawyers will be involved.     As a naive recent college graduate, I came upon an opportunity to work on a side project for a small business owner. We agreed that it would be a side project and I had to get permission from my full-time boss before I could take the project on (proactively avoid any conflict of interests situation). 




    My boss said he thought it wasn't the best idea because he didn't want my focus being pulled away from any client I would be working for at my full time job, but ultimately was okay with me doing the side project (with the caveat of no phone calls for side project while at a client site, and my full time job always comes first). I communicated this situation to the small business owner and he was okay with the situation.




    Long story short, I completely underestimated the project (right out of college, estimation abilities weren't based on reality) and had to enlist the help of 3 other acquaintances to help. We all were working on the project on and off for over a year and there was still some minor development work to be completed plus user testing/bug fixes at the time of him deciding to call off the project.




    Over the course of the year he paid me two payments of equal amount and he paid me as a 1099 employee (the second payment only for the sake of being able to include it in his 2016 taxes). From the first payment I used almost all of it to pay 3 work friends for their help. Almost half of the second payment ended up going towards paying my own taxes from the 1099 income.




    At the end of 2016/beginning of  2017 his business took a huge hit after losing a major client, and he had to downsize to the point where he might be quitting altogether/finding some other opportunity. In the stress of his business falling apart all of the sudden, he burned a lot of bridges and took a lot of his stresses out on others. During this time he told me that we were going to have to scrap the project because he no longer really had a use for it.




    Now, about a month later, he calls me and basically says that he doesn't have a finished product to show for his money and he wants it all back, even if we have to come up with a monthly payment plan. I brought up my time and energy spent on the project and he basically told me that my time doesn't matter, I was supposed to give him this product and I didn't so I owe him everything back. I even told him how half what he paid me had gone to outside help for his project, a large portion to taxes, and I only had a small portion left to show for my own efforts and time; to which he basically replied that that was on me and that my time and efforts are worthless and that if I didn't pay him back he would have no choice but to get his lawyer(s) involved.


So, r/legaladvice, am I pretty much screwed in this situation, or would I even stand any kind of chance in court? He decided to give up on the project and he paid me as a 1099 employee, does that matter in this kind of scenario? I know he is trying to recoup from losses in his business, but just because my efforts are less tangible in his mind (lines of code), it shouldn't discredit my hundreds of hours of effort.

5b60e59cda52255c20d0216c,"[IL] Customer leaves car in Drive, turns off ignition. Mechanic starts car from the outside, car ends up crashing with minor damage. Customer wants compensation.. Personally, I'm more leaning towards the mechanic (my friend) being at fault for failing to follow safety precautions.

When someone hands you a Rifle, the first thing you do is check if it is loaded, even if you literally just witnessed that person emptying the Rifle right in front of you.  In the same way I feel like a car mechanic should do the same and follow basic safety precaution, like checking if the car is indeed in park before starting.  

But then, I'm not sure how stupid another human being has to be to hand someone a loaded Rifle and tell them ""Oh it's not loaded""... aka 'Let's leave my car in Drive, turn off ignition and invite a car mechanic to do repairs on your car'.  I feel like the Customer does have some liability in this case, but I'm not a lawyer.  

Also, I believe it was an older car that made it possible for this stupidity to happen.  I'm not a car expert but I'm pretty sure you have to step on the brakes before ignition on modern cars?  At least that's the way I learned in Driver's Ed when I was 16.  Always step on brakes before starting.  

No one got hurt, the repair amount is really small, I think about $500 bucks for minor bumper damage.  

But I'm wondering ultimately who is at fault considering the possibility that someone could have actually died from this.  

I should probably post this in /r/Justrolledintotheshop/ or /r/mechanics and ask them as I'm sure the mechanics on there have plenty of prior cases similar to this.

Anyway, his soon to be ex is a sucky person. She is overdramatic and always tries to start problems. Throughout their thirteen year marriage, she would walk out or kick him out and always do something dramatic to try and get him to chase after her like they do in all the romcoms. 

This last time was it for him. She slapped him in the face and he shoved her back and held her against the wall, telling her to never touch him again. He didn't slap her or hurt her in any way. He restrained her. So what does she do? Goes out and gets a restraining order against him and feigns ""domestic violence"" and deems him unsafe. She realized that was pushing it over the limit because not even hours after filing it, she tried dropping it. 

Whether it was through text or messenger, she would spam message him appologies and threats intermittently, which I know is grounds for her not being able to get a restraining order later on. Well, ""protective order"" I think.

He is done with that nonsense. And this woman finally realized how good she had it before. She has a job, but it doesn't pay well. And pretty much the moment after she did this and they began the ""separation"" phase, she was demanding money. She wanted like, 1500 bucks per month in child support.

She dropped the order the following week as soon as she could and has been repeatedly begging and threatening him throughout the last three weeks now.

He doesn't have a problem helping his kids, but we know if he keeps helping her she is just going to make it worse for him. And she said that if they do a divorce, she will make it harder on him than necessary because she is vindictive. She wants to do a legal separation so that she can still have power over him.

We have logs of all the messenger conversations and texts between them as written record and he avoids speaking in person as long as possible. He is paying child support and is picking up his kids a couple times a week. 

But he tries to keep minimal contact with her, even when she continues threatening him and saying questionable or incriminating things.

To make a long story short: two months ago, someone messaged me asking for help with an investment fund. He said that he had spend 13 years working on an software trading program that accurately predicts the foreign exchange market. I realized that he was woefully unprepared to run or manage a fund and consulted him on how to set up a fund. He likely was not going to pay me but that's fine, I wanted him to succeed as accomplish his goals.
I later realized that it was very unlikely he had programmed an worthwhile arbitrage code, as he claimed to have, because he showed a lack of understanding for basic macroeconomic concepts. Furthermore, his trading policies involve SEC violations and using boiler room tactics for obtaining funding. Additionally, he nonchalantly expressed that he could choose however much to give back to investors, whenever--indicating a ponzi scheme like distribution. When I expressed my disagreements, he commanded me to get back in line and told me to get him ""operating capital"" for his fund. He had also mentioned knowing cartel members (with implied threat), and saying that he wanted to work with them, thus signaling a money laundering scheme.
I requested that he stop what he was doing and told him that I will not be providing him with operating capital. He then told me that he had recorded all of our conversations and will release all my information public (where I work, live, etc.). He will then call my workplace and pretend to be a client being harass by me, as well as actively seek out my clients and harass them. The gist of his intent is that it'd be easier for me to bribe him to stop, then to file all the legal proceedings to sue him.
Furthermore, he is seeking out attorneys to assist him in harassing me as well as file a lawsuit for having called what he was doing a ponzi scheme.

We needed somewhere to put it so we got a property which was $1000 of downpayment and would be $250 every month. 

We paid someone close to $2000 to move the trailer home into the property. He did and its been there for about 2 weeks now. 

Today my husband got a call from the lady who sold him the property saying that she wants to break contract and move our home elsewhere into another one of her available properties all because the man who lives right next to our property is complaining that our home is too ugly to be next to his or in his immediate vicinity. The lady is siding with him because this man turns out to be the city commissioner. 

The other available properties are not the same as the one we have now. They are by a creek and they pretty much get flooded every time it rains. The lady did offer to pay for someone to move our home again and use the first downpayment for whichever other property we get so we wouldn't have to pay twice but we don't want to settle for less just because this man feels superior to us but we don't know what to do.

I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know). 

Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be  a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point. 

We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to  get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open.

I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?

Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.

Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did?

Hi all, so I'd appreciate it if I could get some advice on this situation. Some context, my grandmother has had three husbands. The first one died when my mother was 3 months old. The second was found to be cheating, was kicked out, and divorced. Her third husband, however, took serious advantage of her being a single mother so he could sexually assault my mother. Unfortunately, this wasn't a one-time thing. He was charged in the early '80s for it. There was a condition for him not to go near anyone under the age of 16 unless they were accompanied by an adult, and a restraining order put on him to not go near my mother. In '85 he built a brand new house, and he wanted my grandmother, uncle and mother to move into this new house that he built, but they all refused because the house they were living in (which is the same house my grandma still resides in), was built by her first husband - their father. So he (her 3rd husband, not her 1st) got drunk one day and sold the house he had built, for pretty much nothing, in an attempt to gain permission to move in to my grandmas house (he still had the restraining order on him at this point), which was successful.

After he moved in, he sexually assualted my mom continuously right up until '96, then he proposed that same year to my grandma, which gave my mother a 6 month respite. What was really odd though, was that he married my grandmother on the same day that is my mother and fathers wedding anniversary. He started sexually assaulting my mother again in '97, right up until 2 years ago. It's a real long, unpleasant story.
Nevertheless, he's in jail as I'm typing this, and my grandmother is actively seeking a lawyer to remove him off her house title. 

My question is; could she get this marriage anulled in order to make the separation easier? She is willing to let him have all of his belongings, including his boat and the only vehicle they have, as long as she gets to keep her house. She see's how twisted this man is now, and wants nothing more to do with him. She wants him and his children off her will, and she wants her relationship restored with us. This man, only last year had another 'peace bond' applied to him, stating that he must remain at least 100m away from my mother and sister at all times.

5b60e59cda52255c20d02368,"Young adult may need to take guardianship of autistic brother. Hi all,

I located in Iowa, am a young adult and will finish college in December. 

I am coming to accept that I will not be able to flee the state after graduation. In short, I do not believe my father and mother are capable of caring for my slightly younger brother with Asperger Syndrome. They failed to do basically anything at all until he turned 18, are too immature themselves and essentially throw tantrums in response to his tantrums, provide little structure in his life and my mother has this idea now that antidepressants will magically make my brother a functioning person.

I think my brothers social abilities have decreased and his anger has increased since he finished high school (he was pushed through with the help of an assistant and my parents basically doing his homework for him) and his social interaction has been more limited to our parents.

He currently lives at home, is over the age of 18 and no one has anytime of legal guardianship over him or his affairs. He is also not enrolled in medicaid, though he does have health insurance through my parents until the age of 26. 

I think that for his well being it is necessary we get legal guardianship over him and have him enrolled in medicaid. Ideally, I think it would be best that I have guardianship over him as my parents have a track record of not being fit to address his needs (we have NO extended family). But, I will not make a lot (if any) money out of college, especially if I stay in this state, and I myself may depend on my parents, who have some money, to live. My goal would be to get him behavioral and life skill therapy and into an assisted living situation.. whether in this state or in another state that has better options.

5b60e59cda52255c20d023cb,"My wife(25F) and I(28M) rent a basement apartment from a couple (25F, 25M). She harasses my wife who has known mental illness. Please help.. Sorry in advance for the long post, and formatting/spelling issues as I'm on mobile.

If you take the time to read it all, I'd really appreciate any help you can offer.

Hey Reddit, I don't have the resources to pay for an attorney's advice, and could really use some help. If you have any advice or have been in our situation, please share your knowledge.

It is helpful to not that my wife has various, diagnosed mental illness problems (generalized anxiety, PTSD, depression, borderline personality disorder.) And she takes prescribed meds to help treat these problems. This is known to my landlord and the upstairs couple and is the reason she has a service dog here.

Back story:
My wife and I rent a (kind of) basement apartment in Colorado. We have 2 rooms, living room/dining area, bathroom and kitchenette(fridge, a little counter space with 2 cupboards and 2 drawers). The upstairs couple has to come downstairs to use the washer and dryer, and we have to go upstairs for the kitchen to cook and wash dishes, etc. 

My landlord is the Aunt of the woman upstairs, and the mother of the woman upstairs is the owner of the house. 

I was originally told that my landlord was the owner of the house, and that the couple upstairs rented from her. A couple months into my lease, my landlord told me that the mother of the woman upstairs is the owner and that she bought the house for the couple upstairs because they have bad credit. So they claim it is their house but is actually in her mother's name. Hopefully that makes sense, it turned out to be a complicated situation.

Regardless of who owns the place, the Aunt is still my landlord(she is the landlord on the lease I signed, and I deal with her directly for any problems with my apartment or people upstairs, and also pay all my bills to her. So the upstairs couple is not involved(with me) at all when it comes to my living space downstairs or the house in general, unless she is harassing and causing problems. 

I have told the couple upstairs multiple times to leave my family alone, and to talk to my landlord about any issues they may have. 

We have lived here since the beginning of March, and signed a 6 month lease.

The problem:
The woman upstairs harasses my wife and I. It has happened about 4 time's since we have lived here. She has gotten in my face yelling, cursing and name calling once. 
This happened because I talked to my landlord about asking them to stop throwing their cigarette butts on the ground, as my 1 year old daughter was picking them up and putting them in her mouth.
Woman upstairs got mad because I wasn't ""adult enough"" to talk to them and had to bring her aunt into it. She also made it clear that we all need to talk to each other and get along because we live together.
I told her that we don't live together, my family rent's the basement, and that we are not here to make friends, but to live a peaceful life and raise our 2 kids.
This is when she began yelling at both of us and calling us names(with our kids present). My wife went inside while I finished my cigarette in the driveway. As I returned to the door to come inside, she began yelling again and cursing and name calling. I walked away and went inside to my basement. That is the only time she has started problems with me.
The other times have been harassing my wife.

The second time she got in my wife's face yelling, cursing and name calling. 

This started because we originally had an agreement to trade off every other weekend with them cleaning dog poop(we have a service dog for my wife, they have 2 dogs). They weren't holding up their end of the deal, so I told my landlord that I'd rather not trade off weeks, and simply clean up directly after my wife's dog poops. After my landlord talked to the woman about it, she became irate, came outside and got in my wife's face name calling and yelling at her(again with my kids present.) I was at work when this happened.

The landlord preferred that we continue trading weeks and I told her we'd try it again and that if there were problems again, we'd be only cleaning after my wife's dog. 

Today while I was at work, she began harassing my wife again, about how she needed to clean up the dog poop, walking around the yard pointing out dog piles. My wife cleaned it all up 2 days ago. She yelled and cursed, name calling again with my kids there. So my wife told her that we'd no longer be cleaning after their animals and would only be cleaning up directly behind my wife's dog when he goes. She wasn't happy, yelled about my wife being a bitch and some other names. 

My wife told her that she was sick of being harassed, and that this is the last time she'd warn her before she calls the police and reports her. 

I have spoken with my landlord each time this has happened, and my landlord has also told me that we're not the first tenants the woman has caused problems with. Landlord has apologized for her niece's behavior, admits that it is unacceptable, and told me that she knows how hard her niece is to live around. Landlord has spoken with the couple upstairs, but nothing changes.

My lease is up at the end of August, so it's not too far away. But, this woman upstairs treating my wife and our family as she has has been detrimental to my wife's mental health. Her mental health has increasingly gotten worse because of this woman's harassment and problems. Another 6 weeks is a very long time for my wife to keep experiencing this treatment, and I'm afraid it's only going to cause her more issues. 

Do I have any options to get out of my lease early and unpenalized? Or are we just trapped and stuck dealing with this crazy lady until the lease is up?

I'd sincerely appreciate and advice or words of wisdom about this as I'm completely lost and have no idea what to do stop it. 

Thanks Reddit.

Last year while I was visiting Paris, I purchase a rather expensive pair of boots I had been saving up months for. I figured I'd buy them in Europe since it's cheaper there ($1036) instead of $1293 in USA. I was told by the salesperson that I would receive a VAT tax refund at the airport after filling out several forms at the shop that I would just have to see customs and get my tax (about $120)refunded to me there. 
I got to the airport, waited in a long line, almost missing my flight and the agents told me that I didn't have the correct form. 
When getting home, I emailed the boutique explaining that I was unable to receive my money.
 The sales person offered to speak to me via WhatsApp and gave me instructions how I could go to my local French Consulate and pay a 35 Euro fee to file the VAT tax return form to EU Customs located in Ireland. I gathered all the documents and made multiple trips to the consulate since each time I kept forgetting the appropriate documents.

I am on the other side of the country and very afraid of getting scammed, so I would really appreciate your advice, as I have searched everywhere and need to make a decision very soon! 

What I have done to avoid getting scammed is (thank you, reddit, for the advice btw):

- had a friend in Seattle go and see the apartment, shown by the same person I spoke to over the phone - she said he seems legit, and the apartment was definitely the same on I saw listed online, same address too
- person sent me a signed lease that is very clear about the terms and seems legitimate (RHA template), after I did an application and he said my credit/background check was fine
- asked person to verify his identity - he sent me a picture of his driver's license, although with his license # and address blacked out
- Googled the hell out of everything I can to verify that he exists (he is listed as a previous tenant of the address on one of those personal info websites but has a generic name so can't find much else), and that the company on behalf of which he is signing the lease actually exists

The thing is, the property owners (it's a small, multi-unit property in Capitol Hill) are a family that have established a LLC to rent out the units, and he claims to be the property manager for 13 years running, and rents out this one furnished unit on a short-term lease because he gets a cut of the monthly payment for having furnished it. But he is not able to show me anything verifying that he has permission to rent out the unit or that he works for this LLC, despite my repeated requests. He claims that the owners are in their 70s and very low-tech and even his paystub doesn't have the company name on it. 

He wants me to send $1000 through Paypal as a deposit to hold the unit, and I have the signed lease in his name, with the LLC listed as the owner, as proof of...something? But should I take the risk? *Is* there a risk - or am I overreacting?

5b60e59cda52255c20d02436,"[UK] Employee lied about reason for leaving at last employer, bad enough that we do not want to keep him on. What do?. Hi reddit,

Got an issue here with a (currently suspended) employee in my place of work, we have not yet hired a legal rep IRL as I would like to get some advice first before we decide to make the investment.

Issue is below:

Employee declared that they had resigned from their previous place of work when we interviewed them. Been employed for a year (passed probation) and due to a tip off (came from outside the business we believe, somebody from their previous place of work), we have now discovered that they were actually dismissed for fraud from the last employer (when they told us they resigned). 

Reference check was done before being offered the position (as per usual), but reason for leaving was not disclosed by the references (we always try and get the reason for leaving if possible). We have no signed documents from the employee confirming their reason for leaving; only written information is interview notes when we interviewed them, but obviously they would not have signed this (and new employees do not normally see their interview notes).

As stated, employee has passed probation so we cannot simply dismiss that easily. Currently suspended employee and waiting for a meeting date, but unsure if we have a case here… he's suspended with pay so I doubt he's worried, probably just got his feet up at home.

Management does not want this employee working for us any longer given what he was dismissed for in the last company and intentionally did not declare it in this one (and as we are an insurance-based company, something like fraud is obviously going to raise warning flags. As stated he is currently suspended (with pay) and is waiting for a meeting date with his manager and HR. He has no previous warnings or anything as such on his record, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't socialise that much (which can go either way to be honest, if he is up to something with our company then it would make sense to keep to yourself).

Sorry for the formatting, this is literally my first reddit post after creeping without an account for a long time. 

I lived in an apartment complex in the suburbs of Chicago for two years. While there, the only damages that I can truthfully say I have caused are the ripping out of a few vertical blinds **(you know, the ones that seem to fall out super easily with little prompting)**  and breaking the microwave handle. 

Needless to say, I expected to pay a small sum for the broken microwave handle. I was not, however, expecting $600!!

I don't have that much to spare on short notice, and I wanted to wait a few weeks anyways to see the itemized list of damages. I never received one. Today, I called their office and alerted them of the fact I never received the itemized list i was supposed to receive (you know, to see what exactly I damaged). The woman who works in the office tells me that she sent one on June 15th, and offered to resend it. I'm sitting there thinking, ""if you really sent it, it must be here. no need"". I cannot for the life of me understand how I've received all my other mail at my forwarding address and this one seems to not have made it. At this point, what can I do? I won't have the money by then. If I received the itemized list on time, I could have disputed any false charges &amp; or simply talked to them. 
Also, I did pay $150 in a surety deposit (non-refundable).

5b60e59cda52255c20d024ae,"[West Virginia] A dog in my neighborhood was unleashed and killed my therapy cat in front of me. The owner of the dog refused to pay for cremation costs, can I sue her for the price of the urn?. Sorry if my post is a little messy, this just happened yesterday and I've been a complete wreck.

A little backstory: my cat was about 13 or 15 years old (I can't recall what age I adopted him, I think I was 7 or 8), and I'd had him since he was about three weeks old, and we grew up together. I have severe anxiety due to mental illness, childhood abuse, and the death of my father, and he was classified as a therapy animal by my therapist who'd I'd been seeing for four years at that point. He was my best and only friend and I'm just beside myself.

On Sunday I let my cat outside (he had arthritis and liked to lie out in the sun for a couple of hours before coming inside, I guess it helped because he started walking better once it got sunny) and went about my day. Later as I was outside, I saw a huge Boxer dog carrying something in his mouth; once I realized it was my cat, I streaked across the lawns to the neighbor's house where I basically had to fight the dog off my cat so I could hold him as he died in my arms. I was inconsolable and traumatized. The owner wasn't present, but her mother was and assured me that she was sorry and informed me that the young child in the house had incorrectly tethered the Boxer dog to its chain, causing it to break out of its yard and run into mine, where it found my cat.

After wrapping my cat up and talking to the owner when she got home, she apologized and offered to pay for any bills, which I accepted. I called a vet, got an estimate for cremation, and everything at that point seemed as settled as it could be.

I walked to her house this morning as I was headed over to the vet appointment to ask her for the finances she offered, and she refused, saying she didn't have the money and that she has leukemia and simply doesn't make enough to cover the bills. I told her I was sorry that she was ill but she is responsible for my cat's death and she needed to take responsibility, and she told me to contact her attorney. My mom offered to pay for my cat's cremation, but now I don't have money for an urn to put the ashes in (the vet doesn't offer free urns so it would come in a sealed bag).

**Since she told me to take her to court, I'm here asking for advice. Here's a TL;DR bulletpoint with information**

**My therapy cat was killed by an unleashed Boxer dog and the owner refuses to take financial responsibility.**

* The leash law in West Virginia states: 

&gt; §19-20-13. Dog running at large; liability of owner. 
&gt; Any owner or keeper of any dog who permits such dog to run at large shall be liable for any damages inflicted upon the person or property of another by such dog while so running at* large.

* My city within West Virginia's leash law states:

&gt;  The City Code of Ordinances Chapter 4 states that ""no person shall allow any dog owned by him or in his custody to run at large within the city. The term ""running at large"" means allowing a dog to leave the property limits of property owned, leased or occupied by its owner without restraint. The term ""restraint"" means being secured by a leash or lead, or being under the control of a responsible person and obedient to that person's command.""

* The owner admitted fault and offered to pay for damages
* The owner then refused to pay for damages she previously offered
* The owner requested that I take her to court
* The owner verbally attacked me when I went to her house on Monday (I don't know if this is relevant but I'm including it)
* The owner admitted negligence in allowing her young child to handle a Boxer dog three times her size (again I don't know if this is relevant but she admitted to being negligent in this respect)
* The owner keeps three dogs in a 3x4 kennel in the backyard, which is way too small for the size of her dogs
* The owner admitted that her Boxer dog was actually looking for a different cat that has been wandering around her yard lately, so she admitted to knowledge that her dog had vicious intent but did nothing to prevent it

I can't think of anything else. I don't want pain and suffering money, I don't want to hurt her, I just want her to pay for the price of my cat's urn.

He proceeded to text threats for the next few days until I blocked his number. I immediately filed the police report and had my landlord there while the police were the following day. The roommate who threatened me continued to live there so i moved out within a week. I sent a letter to my landlord describing the situation and how there is a legitimate fear of my life because this roommate has a past history of violence.

I then did what this paragraph said and sent a letter with the police report via certified mail.

The Safe Housing Act allows victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and child abuse to terminate a lease if they feel they are in imminent threat of physical harm by remaining on the premises, and have an accepted form of documentation (a restraining order, condition of release, or a criminal complaint). Very specific rules apply. To end a lease under these laws, tenants with a term lease must write a letter to the landlord saying that they wish to end their lease under Wis. Stat. 704.16 because they and/or their child(ren) face an imminent threat of physical harm, and provide a certified copy of the accepted documentation (example: a court order) to the landlord. Under these limited circumstances, the lease would end as if giving a termination notice for a month-to-month tenancy. Wis. Stat. 704.16, Wis. Stat. 704.16(1)(b)

My roommates said they had found someone to take my place, but that must have fallen through. Now it is July. I am now hearing that my landlord is pursuing legal action against me, but I have only heard about this just recently and have not been served.

My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well.

Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?

Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.

We (Family of 4) are currently living in Boston and leasing a property. It is an old brownstone multi-story with different tenants on each floor. We are very clean people who occupy the bottom two floors.  We recently (after 6 months or so) began to notice pest droppings on the floor, it turns out it is from mice. New people moved in upstairs recently and we think the mice probably got into the building during the process. We informed the landlord immediately and sent pictures etc. and he came and set some traps, but suggested there was no point in an exterminator (""they only set traps too""). Every day since we are finding mice droppings in the home. There are gnaw marks on the floorboard by the wall, we noticed lots of holes in the old bricks on the wall, and they are able to travel up through the floorboards from inside the cavity behind the wall downstairs. Generally there are holes in a lot of places, and we have been trying to plug them up with steel wool etc. We have young two kids (1 &amp; 2 y.o.) and are fearful of one of them picking up droppings or a mouse entering their room/crib and biting them or carrying disease. Essentially we want to vacate the property asap, we don't feel safe and are uncomfortable eating or sleeping here. I have already killed one mouse but have also seen more. Our rent is around $3000 a month and we are unsure of whether we can claim back any of the rent we have paid out once we vacate. Our lease is up on 9/1 and has already been paid until then. Do we just walk away, could we claim back some of the 4500 or so we have paid? Any advice would be appreciated.",,,,,,,,0.25,,,,,0.75,,,,,,,

  My coworker (we'll call him Steve) has a 17 year old son. Steve's neighbor is a pretty old crotchety guy (We'll call him OCG) and likes to make noise complaints. OCG even said so to Steve when Steve first moved in. OCG complained to Steve once in person and Steve says to let him know any time he has any problems with noise so he may deal with his son (who may be loud at times because he is 17 years old). He also happens to mention he works at a medium sized company in town (We'll call it McCompany). OCG rents from the property management department in McCompany. Steve does not work in this department, however. 

  The next time OCG decides to complain he goes to the property management department of McCompany and asks the manager to mention this to Steve through his employer connections. Steve tells this to me because he found it weird. Steve also finds out that OCG had tried to file a complaint with the police.


What Happened Today:

OCG decided to visit McCompany's HR department, introduced himself as Steve's neighbor and asked where Steve works because ""He just wants to say 'Hi'"". The HR girl happily leads him into our office, then HR girl pops in and asks where Steve is and I casually mention he was out for some personal stuff and will be back shortly. That's when she mentions to me ""His neighbor is here to say 'Hi'.""

Last year, myself and hundreds of others put our money down on a product called a ""Marble DCS"". The company is an established company with another successful product. The ""DCS"" was offered in two versions, the DCS-1 and DCS-2. 

The promised ship date or the DCS-1 was October 2016. Units were finally being reported as received by backers in May 2017, 9 months after the promised ship date.

She has been in and out of the hospital every month for the past few years. First it was heart issues, and another was breathing problems. She got many heart surgeries, including heart valve and stents. She has had heart attacks too. She barely has any muscle on the back of her neck, so its hard on her to look up while at work.

I almost lost my mom many times. I'm 20, she is 52. All of these problems are from the radiation she endured in her twenties.

I served two months earlier this year and am out. I have a decent job now, however a couple ""dream jobs"" have opened up lately.
Here is where I run into an issue. I do not know what to answer on the ""Have you been convicted of a felony (sometimes it asks for lower level crimes too, misdemeanor, etc) box. Now before you say to tell the truth, Oregon law EXPLICITLY does not allow that question. Oregon law HB 3025 states: This legislation prohibits an employer from requiring an applicant: to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction; to disclose, prior to an initial interview, a criminal conviction; or if no interview is conducted, to disclose, prior to a conditional offer of employment, a criminal conviction.
Portland (where I live) then takes it a step farther, basically stating that they must offer conditional employment before asking about a conviction. They are not even allowed to ask DURING the interview. They must first offer me a conditional offer of employment (cuz ya know, Oregon). After that, if they learn that I have a felony, they can only rescind if the felony directly applies to the line of work I would be in.
So this leaves me in a weird spot. When filling out job applications, local companies and national companies (even ones with large legal divisions, think Amazon, various national mortgage agencies) ask that question. It is yes, or no, and you cannot proceed without selecting an answer. Do I tell the truth and have a 0% chance at getting the job, or do I lie since they are breaking a law by even asking that question?
It gets even more complicated when looking at tax breaks for hiring felons. They get $2400 for hiring a felon within 1 year of his release date, and are protected by a federal bonding program where they can receive $5,000 fidelity bonds, free of charge, as an incentive to hire job seekers that do not qualify for commercial fidelity bonds. Some applications afterwards have you fill out a WOTC where it asks you questions about foodstamps, government assitance, and being a felon. If we decide that lying is the best course of action, do I then tell the truth on the WOTC part of the application to then not be considered a felon on the part of the application where I am being illegally discriminated against, but be considered a felon on the tax credit part where being a felon works to the companies advantage?

Backstory: My family has permanent residency status for the US from Canada, and everybody minus my dad have moved here and lived here for at least 2 years.

He has visited the US frequently, but never stayed longer than a month.

The current situation: Dad's mother was in a coma, and her condition is deteriorating, so he intends to visit her overseas, then visit us before going back to Canada. Before leaving Canada, he was stopped by immigration and they interviewed him because he has never remained in the US since green card was approved 3+ years ago, apparently not following the rules. They said they were notating the account, and though they cannot take away the green card, they could send him to court to appeal. He took the flight, but they said he is taking a risk, and the US airport might withold the card or prevent him from flying. His cousin (immigration attorney) said he could fill out a travel request application, but it could take 6 weeks.

He's in the NY airport currently, and likely will continue to fly overseas to visit his mother, but that may jeopardize the permanent residency process my parents have spent so many years and money working on. Is this a possibility, and what can we do to minimize the risk?

5b60e59cda52255c20d025c5,"I [31m/US/NE] am concerned about my child being psychologically abused by my ex [29f/US/TN]. In order to fully understand the level of confidence I have in the opinion that my daughter is being abused psychologically would take a very long time. I will give the highlights.

My ex and I got divorced due to deployment related stress in 2010 when my daughter was 2. She moved back and forth between TN and NE during my deployments and eventually, after the divorce, she settled back in NE because of better schools and better standard of living (Omaha vs Memphis).

During the time that she lived in NE, I was unable to see my daughter frequently both due to a refusal to cooperate from my ex and my continuing deployments.

I got out of the military and hoped it would be a good opportunity for me to make up with lost time, but I was met with the same lack of cooperation as before so I really only saw my daughter a couple times a year (always only at her mom's house).

I filed for a custody hearing, my ex never responded to the notification so we had the sheriff's office serve her. The day after we got our receipt of service, she moved to TN.

Since the proceedings, the lack of cooperation because a full force of loathing and spitefulness from her. Her dad wanted to fight me in front of my daughter and told me I wasn't allowed on his property. My ex has sworn at me and called me things like an asshole in front of my daughter. My ex's mom has said, in front of my daughter, that I abandoned her.

After many proceedings and a trial-style hearing on the record I was able to secure some visitation times including the school vacations. I was so excited to get her for the very first extended period since she was 2 years old, now she's 8. That excitement and blissfulness of being with my daughter is now accompanied with total anxiety.

My ex got our daughter a phone, she said that she's supposed to have to have the phone on her at all times both in TN and in NE, but I have a lot of evidence suggesting that she doesn't get her phone in TN (i.e. a complete wipe of my text messages and phone calls from her phone when she showed up here this summer).

Through conversation it is fairly obvious that my daughter has been coached about a lot of this stuff with the phone (i.e. how to always keep location on, to call her mom every morning and every night, and not letting me or my wife see the phone as well as password protecting it).

All things considered, it was really easy to get access to my 8 year old daughter's phone and the things that have been going on this summer are startling.

My ex has interrogated her nightly about her situation and what me and my wife do, more so than asking about what all she's been doing and if she's having fun or not.

She has consistently thrown shade on me over and over, though that is to be expected I guess. I am the type that tells the truth to my daughter unless it could negatively impact their relationship, I'm not about that bullshit shade-throwing.

She told my daughter only to speak to her when she can be away from me and my wife and is always asking if either one of us have had access to her phone.

In the last few weeks my daughter has really warmed up to being here and has put her phone on the back-burner most of the time. She's fucking 8 years old and she doesn't give a shit about the phone, she just worries that she's going to be in trouble if she doesn't keep it on her (she's told me so).

During those few weeks she has been unresponsive at times that she's having a sleepover or she left her phone at home. On nights that she doesn't respond, my ex is very harsh.

During a vacation to Texas my daughter left her phone in the car overnight. The next morning, my ex had sent her a text before she went to work saying that she was up all night crying and didn't get any sleep because she didn't hear from her.

Tonight, she threatened to call the cops because she wasn't responding and had her FBI ex-boyfriend blowing up her phone as well.

1) I have all of these things from her phone backed up, but I don't own the phone. The communications are taking place in my house and concern my child. Is that information admissible in an informal hearing setting... I know that if I were able to subpoena the records from the phone company that would be admissible during a trial, I just want to know if I'm going to be breaching any privacy laws by having the information (hence the throwaway).

2)I'm legitimately freaked out about what my daughter is going through, what the fuck can I do to stop it?

Hoping someone with knowledge of Taiwanese finance can chime in.

I was born in Taiwan and when I was young my mother bought me some sort of fund - she told me recently that it has grown massively.

However, I moved here when I was very young and have since become a US citizen. I'll be returning to Taiwan next year for an internship and while I was there I wanted to move the money to the US so I could more easily access the funds. 

The thing is, since I've turned 18, the my mother could no longer access the money, only I can. Since I've moved, I've changed my last name (technical adoption) and am not sure how to prove to them that I am in fact me.

We have a wonderful 6 year old child and have owned a home together for 2 years. Due to her infidelity, staying together is no longer an option in our lives. We purchased a home in 2015 for approx. $275,000. The home is in a good neighborhood and the value has raised since the purchase. I believe it is now worth near $400,000 due to the crazy housing market of our city. Her wonderful father helped us out greatly in acquiring our home. He gave us $10,000 for a down payment and co-singed on the mortgage as well. He hasn't helped in any other way financially. We both appreciate everything he has done for us.

We both pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. Her and I have always split bills 50/50. I have 2 utilities in my name, she has 2 in hers. She generally handles the finances so the mortgage payment to the bank comes from her checking account. I pay her in cash every month for my share of the mortgage and we split all other things right down the middle.

We hired these three guys who gave us an incredibly low price to remodel a condo that we purchased in May. They started work on our place on June 1 and were supposed to be done on June 30. He told us that he would remodel our place for a certain amount: $13,500. These same guys did renovation work for our neighbor in the same condo community, so we made a huge mistake and simply made everything verbal instead of writing it down. I asked him to write it down, but he never actually did even though he promised to do so.

So, the first week, the lead contractor bailed on us and went on vacation while the other two guys started sound demolition work. Everything was fine, until he came back a week later and started asking for more money to do other things. We thought, ""okay, we are asking him to move some walls around and some things are more expensive,"" so we just allowed it and paid extra. This became a common occurrence as things progressed; he started telling us that we had to pay for faucets, for light fixtures, for shower doors, etc., and we had no recourse because we didn't write anything down

Two weeks later, after there was not a ton of work done, the lead guy tells us that his wife's grandmother was in an accident in Mexico. He left the country for two weeks, and his other guys did work. He came back last Friday, and we didn't even know what to say to him because we are paying for rent in our old place while waiting for our new place to become livable. He didn't say too much to us either, and they left and took all of their tools on Friday.

They were supposed to come back on Saturday, but never showed up. I blew up this guy's phone, and he finally answered and said that he wasn't going to work for us anymore because we ""disrespected him by ignoring him.""

I just moved into a new place as of the 3rd and am sharing a bedroom in a 4bd/1bth unit with a roommate from the previous place. Today, the master tenant texted me directly and asked that me and my roommate be out of the house from 9 pm to 10 pm as the landlord was coming over to fix a door in our room that leads to the fire escape, and that we needed to be out of the way as the landlord didn't know we were renting the room out (contrary to what I was told when I moved in). I was also told I was not allowed to sit in the living room either. 
I became suspicious as the door works perfectly fine and I recorded this fact on my phone pre-emptively. I then took two old phones I had and set them at two different angles in my room, recording both video and audio and left the room for the hour.
I came back, checked the videos- it was a full interaction of the main tenant showing our room to someone, making derogatory comments about us, implying that the room was available right now and then leaving. No landlord at all. I copied over these videos to my hard drive, then went out with my roommate to talk to the main tenant who was in the living room. She told us that she didn't know us very well, her friend needed a room, and so we had to be gone by Sep. 1, and lying to me about who was entering our room was no big deal. I informed her that I would need a written and notarized 30 day notice, which she said she didn't need to give me because I don't have a written lease with her as the main tenant.
However, having dealt with eviction before, I know that a) as of August 4th, I will be fully protected under occupant/tenant rights, and b) that I can file a protest of unlawful eviction with the SF rent board, which I plan to do as soon as she actually gives me a non-verbal notice/August 4th comes, whichever one is first.

Other info:
We paid our rent and security deposit in full, by check, dated, with notes, etc. and said checks have been cashed. 
Texted main tenant asking for reason for eviction, she has not replied.
I am not sure of how CA recording law specifically applies to recording in my own unit/room, as I placed them there under suspicion of someone entering the unit who was not the landlord. I believe that audio is not allowed, but video is- I'd just like confirmation of it.

5b60e59cda52255c20d026fa,"I paid to rent a home from a vacation rental company and the minute I arrived to the home, they cancelled my reservation.. Hello,

I am absolutely infuriated by this situation and wanted to know if anyone had any advice on what to do. I personally live in Arizona, however this company is located in Southern California, Newport CA to be exact. 

So I rented a home at the beginning of May for the fourth of July weekend for me and 4 of my friends. I am 22 years old and wanted a place for me and all of my friends who have recently graduated to rekindle and hangout for the 4th of july. My friends and I each paid an even amount for the rental and gave it to my friend Joe. I went ahead and made the reservation and paid for the reservation with Joe's card. The full amount (roughly $4,000) was charged to the card immediately after making the reservation. The company sent me a confirmation email stating that the reservation had been made and sent me a bunch of information, including and email stating that the realtor would send me the lock combination to get into the home closer to the date of our stay.

I want to make it clear that a lot of homes in newport require you to be roughly 30 or older to rent a home. That is why I searched for days and finally found a rental company that allowed you to make reservations as long as you were 21 years of age or older. Considering that I, along with everyone in my party, was over the age of 21, I found that home to be perfect for us. 

Fast forward to the day that we are supposed to arrive. We had the place booked for July 2nd-6th. On July 1st, at 5pm in the afternoon, I recieved an email requesting a photo of myself, a photo of my driverse license and a picture of the card on file. Unfortunately since I was traveling, I did not see the email until the next morning. (July 1st was a sunday, I did not expect to recieve an email on a sunday from them) Anyways, the very next morning I was happy to send them all of my information, however I explained to the realtor that I did not have a copy of the card on file considering that it had been lost by my friend Joe a few weeks back and he had since replaced the card. The reservation had already been paid in full nearly two months prior. Immediately after stating this, she said she would have to speak with a supervisor and get back to me. This was on July 2nd around 10 am, when our entire friend group had already traveled to newport and we were essentially pulling up to the driveway of the home. She then calls me back and states that since we do not have the card, that she has to cancel the reservation. She proceeded to cancel the reservation and said she would refund the money. I kindly explained to the realtor that the card had been cancelled, and that we would HAPPILY give them another card to keep on file for security purposes. She told me that since it wasnt the card that we paid with, there was nothing she can do. 

Since they sent me that email less than 24 hours prior to our check in time, I had no idea that they required that card from us. Or else I wouldve called and notified them prior. When I asked her ""how was I supposed to know"" she responded, ""its in the rental agreement"". I immediately read through the entire rental agreement from beginning to end and I found NOTHING that remotely mentions anything about us having to have the card. She then said that ""since the card doesnt match the name on file, that is a red flag, so we cancelled your reservation"". So at this point, I feel like I am being lied to because now shes changing stories as to why she cancelled the reservation. I called back and kindly spoke with a supervisor and asked them to show me where in the rental agreement it states that we need to provide a picture of the card on file, or where it states that the card used to make payment needs to match the reservation. She hostilly responded, ""Sir, this is not a negotiation. Your reservation has been cancelled. Goodbye."" and then hung up the phone. 

We were left there, sitting in front of the house, after traveling several hours, essentially homeless. They said that the money was refunded, however, that takes on average 3-5 business days, so we couldnt even use the $4,000 to rent another home or hotel room. We ended up having to pay for a hotel room for the night and buy flights back the next morning/drive back home. 

I am honestly at a loss for words about this situation. I could not believe that a company could do this to a client. I believe that when I sent her a picture of my driverse licsense, she saw that I was only 22 and figured that since it was the fourth of july, that they could rent the home to someone ""Better"" for more money. I eventually found out that they ended up renting the home to a husband and wife for the fourth of july. 

I am very upset because I had paid for this reservation two months prior, and they held the money in their account for 2 months. They then proceed to send me check in instructions less than 24 hours prior to my check in, and then cancelled the reservation. I do not understand how they can get away with this. I wish they would atleast have contacted me with the check in instructions a few days prior to our reservation.

Does anyone know what kind of attorney I should speak with about this? Or does anyone have any advice who works in this industry? I would greatly appreciate all advice.

5b60e59cda52255c20d02751,"Mechanic ripped my mom off. Hi,
Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post, but here's my story.

My mom hears some flipping noise when driving, so she takes her car to firestone tires.(where she bought her tires)

1. Firestone- recognized that 2 tires were recalled, so they replaced 2 tires for free. Problem still persisted.

2. Mobil- So then she takes the car to the gas station the next day and the guy says the problem is the AXLE BOOT and STRUTS. Left side on the front was leaking. They said they would have to replace all 4 axles for total of $780. She says nope too much.

3. Valero- next my mom takes the car to the Valero gas station down the street and repeated everything that just happened, and he said that he will order the front STRUTS(not the entire axle) and get the problem fixed, and he won't do the back ones. 
So at the end, he replaced the entire left axle(leaking)(which never told her he was gonna do) and front struts, total $480. 

THEN AT THE END, HE SAYS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE BACK TIRE WAS THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
The other used tire in the back was ""feathering"", causing the noise. ($50 problem)

So he misdiagnosed, overcharged, and replaced parts that never needed replacing in the first place.

So tomorrow we are gonna get the original parts as evidence that they were not the problem nor they were damaged.

Also, the receipt invoice does not say anywhere the diagnosis of the problem. He never looked at the car, just did what he felt like basically. 

So she wants a refund of her money. Any suggestions??",,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25
5b60e59cda52255c20d0272d,"Questions about Missouri Probation, And violations for Failure to Pay Restitution. - LONG but Urgent.. Hello /r/legaladvice 

This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.


When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k. 

Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing. 

The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.

-----

Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.

2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.

Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.

-----

So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,

I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.

One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)

But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?

[Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?

[Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)

[However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).

What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.

I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!

Right now I'm trying to figure out where her rights start and his end. And also if it would be worth applying for guardianship, I'm only 25 and not exactly that established yet. Would applying for her guardianship allow me to hold him accountable for decisions?

I just hate the idea that he's making these life decisions she doesn't agree with. He's doing this under the guise of it being in her best interest, but if that were the case he would allow her to be apart of that decision and would be sensitive to the fact that her husband just died four months ago. He wants the sell the house she's lived in for over 17 years and put her there within the next few months.

• She is 8 month pregnant and is about to give birth in Thailand.

• As the title has already stated, she is Thai (Bangkok), her husband is Chinese. (Yunnan province, Kunming city)

• My sister and her husband have only sign their marriage certificate in China; they didn't sign one in Thailand.

• She has asked a Thai lawyer who is her friend about this. The lawyer has said that in China, the child can only get the Chinese passport if both of the parents are Chinese. Therefore my sister's son will automatically only be qualified for Thai nationality. The lawyer, however, does not specialize in this field of legal matters.

• On a Thai platform, another Thai woman said that she has asked the China Embassy in Thailand and they said that if the birth certificate states that the child is Thai, they can only provide China's visa with annual renewal terms. However if the birth certificate states that the baby is 'not of Thai nationality', then the embassy can provide the child with the Chinese passport so the family can bring the child back to China to continue with the proceedings. When the woman went to ask at the district office, they said that since the mother is Thai, they can only state in the birth certificate that the child is Thai and cannot state that the child is 'not of Thai nationality'.

My husband and I bought a new car in March. It was a showroom demo, so it was last year's model and had 10k on it. The manufacturer rebates let us upgrade to a nicer model because it had those kilometers on it. 

At the beginning of May, we brought it in and told them it was leaking from the arm on the driver's side. They tried to say oh maybe the door wasn't shut right. I insisted they look anyways and once they pulled the interior plastic off and put the hose to it, it was like a sprinkler. They ended up pulling off the windshield and reseating it in new seals. At that point I paid nothing because of the warranty.

Now here we are over two months later. We've had a bad smell in the car for about a week. Took a few days to get into the dealer's shop. Asked them to do the free full inspection we got at 3 months owning the car and try to find the smell.

Turns out the back seat floor carpet (we are very very rarely in the backseat as it's just the two of us) is soaking wet and growing mold. 

It's been raining a ton here lately, and we're both anal about closing windows since water in car = bad and nobody likes a wet butt. A couple weeks back it was raining so hard people were pulling over from low visibility, and we thought we heard water in the car but assumed it was splashing in the wheel well. 

When the dealer service guy called back he told me this, said I had to have left a window open, and that I'd need to get the car detailed to ditch the smell. 

I explained while it's not impossible that we left a window open, it's very unlikely, and our car had an established history of fucking leaking water inside. The guy repeated what he said and told us our car could be picked up. I hung up with him and called back to speak to the manager in service. 

I told the manager I was beyond frustrated because we bought new specifically to avoid things like this. If we were gonna dump this much money into a car every year instead of it being a 13 year old junker trying to stay driving might as well buy new. I explained I didn't like being told it's my fault too bad, same as last time when I was told I must have ""shut the door wrong"" and it was a leak. That I suspect it's a leak again. That I don't want to come back for ""oop third time's the charm found all the leaks"". Service Manager laughed and said he doesn't want me in again unless it's routine service. 

At this point the manager is sending it to a body shop owned by a good guy who my family sends all our business too, and I called him and he'll have his guys go through the car top to bottom to make sure everything is sealed right. 

I'm very concerned about damage to the car. It's not even 4 months old. 

1. At what point is the car a ""lemon"" and does that kind of thing even apply here? 

2. What happens if the floor boards are rusted from the wet carpet for so many weeks (and who knows how long before that? Last summer when the sales guy drove it around?)

3. What happens if I keep finding leaks for all eternity? 

4. What steps should I take to resolve this if things aren't being fixed? Like dealer/owner first, then corporate, then lawyer? My insurance? The warranty people?

5b60e59dda52255c20d027f8,"Bought a block of land without knowing the streets water main runs through the verge and is higher than the level of the block. Have to pay $5k to get it lowered.. So my partner and I have bought a street front block which was one of the three lots subdivided from an original corner block. It's 324m2 and in an old residential area. 
We were not told when purchasing the block that the water mains for the street runs through the verge and would need to be lowered to allow for a crossover to be added to the block once construction was complete. We actually found out about this when a bobcat drove over it and burst it because it was only buried by 10cm of sand.
We aren't able to increase the level of the verge because it would make the driveway far too steep so our only option is to pay to have the mains dropped. The estimated cost is $5000, although they can charge more once works are completed if necessary. 
This is obviously a huge financial blow for us. This is our first home and we really don't want to sink our savings for furniture, fencing, landscaping etc into this pipe. 
We know that when the conditions for subdivision were given to the land owner there was no mention of the water pipe so even though they probably should have mentioned something when we bought it, I don't think there is anything we can do about that.
My question is, is the water corporation at fault for not recommending to the land developer that the pipe had to be lowered. My understanding of subdivision approval is to ensure all lots are able to be built on and ours currently can't. So many people I've spoken to have said they believe the water corp is at fault for not making this a condition of approval but the water corp of course admits no fault and just wants us to pay.

5b60e59dda52255c20d028e1,"[WV] Steps to take when a dealership can't repair your vehicle?. I bought a 2014 Ford fusion used about 6 months ago. A few days after having it I found out it has some issue where it goes into the limp home mode if you accelerate too quickly. This means power train service light and airbag light come on and the car refuses to accelerate normally until turned off and back on again. It's sometimes accompanied by a check engine light but not always. I bought it with a third party extended service warranty that covers almost everything and it still has the manufacturers power train warranty. 

It was bought used at a non Ford dealership who initially tried to repair it under their warranty for me, but they were unable to diagnose it and they had me take it to a Ford dealership and they would pay for it. 

Over the course of about 4 months and 5 visits, they replaced a mass airflow sensor, the battery, and the throttle body. None of that fixed the issue. 

I took it to a different Ford dealership but they were unable to fix it under warranty (the third party warranty required it be fixed at the selling dealer if I was within 40 miles of it) and they wouldn't honor the power train warranty. I took it back to the welling dealer who said they couldn't diagnose it and they told me to go to Ford. I took it back to the Ford they sent me to previously and they said it would take them several days to diagnose it and asked me to come back later. 

At this point I was in the process of moving across the state, so I moved and found a Ford dealer near me and took it there. They kept it for a week and replaced the accelerator pedal. The check engine light came back on with the same code so I took it back the next day. They turned the code off and test drove it for a while and it didn't come back so they stated it was fixed. 

I picked it up again and the original limp home mode issue happened again so in immediate dropped it off again. That was yesterday, and at this point its been at the third ford garage for 2 weeks now. I've been to garages for the same issue about 7 times or so over the last 6 months.

I received the paycheck slightly under two years ago, and looking at Michigan's laws, it looks to me like my pay would've gone to the state after a year, so that makes sense.

My question is basically about how I might proceed to get legal counsel for the issue in the Philadelphia area - and I believe it's an unusual issue, but you let me know.

I have a dog who, for some medically unknown reason, has a history of bone fractures and orthopedic surgeries. Last year, he broke his front leg and received surgery at an orthopedic veterinary specialist clinic. This involved attaching a plate with screws to the broken bone. About two weeks after, the plate became detached, and he became lame. I brought him to the same clinic to diagnose the issue, and they incorrectly diagnosed it.

5b60e59dda52255c20d02cdb,"Flooded and ""totaled"" vehicle refused by insurance company.. My Ford F250 flooded in the Louisiana flooding in August 2016.  I called and turned the claim into insurance company immediately.  An adjuster came out and gave a “basic” estimate and said the mechanic shop we chose to take it to would check it over more and see what else needed to be done.  The shop and the adjuster decided it could be “FIXED” instead of totaled out. Small things were done here and there to ""fix"" the truck but it never ran right again and when I would get it back it would break again days after leaving the shop. I decided that the Ford dealership was apparently not going to be able to resolve anything as this had been months of back and forth so it was then brought to a diesel mechanic shop, after finally finding one that would accept the job (most places would not even accept the truck because ""it should have been totaled""). The diesel mechanic said, as the others did, that this was a vehicle that needed to be totaled, he told me and he told the insurance company multiple times. They always denied totaling the vehicle because they ""Goggled it and it could be fixed"". 
I submitted a claim to the Louisiana Dept of Insurance and after a month they decided it a closed case as there was ""no proof that water got into the engine"" and caused the truck to be damaged beyond repair.   
Now this is where I am completely lost, I have a ""totaled' vehicle (even though the insurance company refuses to total it, it is still just a sitting hunk of truck). It now sits at the mechanic shop because it will need to be towed away and this man has been nice enough to let it stay there as we were in the middle of disputes with the insurance company. His next ""fix"" will cost 5k and may or may not fix this truck, his thinking is more likely NOT. I am completely tapped as I have bought a ""cheap"" car to get me by and it is constantly needing this or that done to it as it is a 1986. BUT my 250 is still financed through the bank and pay off is over 22k. 
Is there anything that I could do to try to get out from under this truck? It's ruined so it is not worth anything at all but still has a 22k price tag on it. I have considered letting it be repossessed but that sounds like the worst idea possible for my credit. I just don't know if there is anyway at all to get out of this without ruining my credit, I am now in a huge financial bind with no vehicle and no where to turn.

5b60e59dda52255c20d02cfe,"Shady Car Dealer loan - inflated down payment. AB, Canada. Hey r/legaladvice!

A friend's  sister recently bought a car that my friend co-signed for. They said they felt like the dealership was acting shady at the time, but the sister was really eager to get her car and they signed quickly.

They are realizing now that the dealership probably committed fraud with our loan contract and down payment. They inflated the down payment AND the price of the vehicle by $3000, then wrote a cheque for the extra $3000 and called it a day, saying verbally that this was just so the bank would allow the loan. They had also paid an additional $2000 for a down payment so to me it doesn't make sense why the bank would need more, since they framed it like any amount would do. At the time it made sense and seemed ok.

Now they are calling saying that my friend and her sister have a ""serious issue"" and that they owe the outstanding $3000 for the down payment claiming it was never paid for.

They are planning on contacting a local lawyer before discussing with the dealership further, but I just hoping to get some information in what they could expect. Is my friend actually in the wrong for allowing the dealership to deceive her? Is the dealership in the wrong for drawing up a fraudulent document? Does it depend on any other factors? Would it be best just to pay it to make it go away? Could this significantly affect their credit rating? What about ownership of the car?

I have scoured the web for any bad review of this dealership and while I see the typical stuff (overpriced service, pushy salesmen), I can't find anyone complaining about a deception of this magnitude so we are hoping that it is just a midunderstanding.

This happened in Alberta, Canada.

Long story short, about 9 years ago I ended up damaging someone's property (twice!) as a result of two farming equipment accidents. As a result of it, I agreed to pay them $15K to settle their civil cases against me. We signed and notarized the repayment agreement, in which I was supposed to pay a certain amount per month.  A variety of family problems were present and I really didn't have the money, so the person specifically put into the contract that they could grant me reprieves from the agreed upon payment schedule if necessary, but that they had the right to rescind those reprieves at any time for any reason and have me continue upon the normal payment schedule. Basically, if I didn't have money to pay them in August, they could say don't worry about it pay me in September or something like that. After signing the agreement, I had a variety of unforeseen things happen to me, and the person told me don't worry about paying it back right now. I basically never brought it up to them again, moved and hadn't heard about it since. About two months ago, I received a certified letter in the mail from an attorney stating that ""any abeyance in payment is hereby revoked"" and that payment would be expected the following month at the law firm's address, as well as a copy of the signed contract.

She is not allowed to leave the house for anything but work or school. She's had a history of self-harm, eating disorder, and various mental illness. Her parents have actively berated her for these issues, saying 'you're a disgrace to this family' 'you ruined our lives' etc. She's gotten in trouble for sneaking out and smoking cigarettes, sure, not right, but the punishment was a closed hand beating every time. She was caught trying to sneak out last night, and in a weird trance, told her mother everything she's done. She admitted to not believing in God, having multiple boyfriends (which is not allowed), and still smoking. 


Now, her father, who is a pilot, is away for now, and she wants to get out before he comes home. There's been multiple instances of the mother having to stand between her and the father to stop further harm being done to her. Her life is genuinely in danger, as not believing in God is about the worst thing she could've said.

I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother. 

Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.

I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge. 

Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three?

I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k. 

 Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership. 

I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price).

On July 7th I was watching a western movie when my wife yelled at me to come help her through the screen door. I rushed on to my deck to see what was going on. My wife was bleeding from the hand, and the neighbors cat was hissing at her. The hairs on the its back were standing up, and it looked pissed. The cat stood blocking me and my wife from my grandson The cat swiped in our direction then slowly walked in the direction that my grandson was in as he cried. I drew my .45 (note I had it in a concealed holster, which I have a license for) and fired 3 shots into the cat, who died. 

I then obviously called my wife and ambulance. She had to get several stitches, it was a whole mess. The police filed a report notified the neighbor, and now the neighbor is threatening to sue me. Claiming that her cat was docile and was not violent.

In June 2016 I signed a lease that commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017. This was my first time renting an apartment and I was unaware that it is common etiquette to provide 30 days notice before moving. I did not provide 30 days notice, instead I messaged my landlord a few days before moving. Today (7/11/17) I just received a text message from my landlord stating that I must pay the rent for July or they will take me to court, and that I should have given 30 days notice. 

Here's the details:
* The term of my lease commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017
* There was no automatic renewal clause
* I did not receive written notice 15-30 days prior to the ending of the lease that there was an automatic renewal clause 
* Nothing was written in the lease stating I had to give 30 days (or any number of days) notice before leaving

The only relevant wording I can find in the lease are these two statements:

* ""Upon giving written notice no later than 60 days before the expiration of the term of this Lease, the Tenant may renew this Lease for an additional term"" 

* ""During the last 30 days of this Lease, the Landlord or the Landlord's agents will have the privilege of displaying the usual 'For Sale' or 'For Rent' or 'Vacancy' signs on the Premises""
 
I feel bad for breaking common etiquette and not letting my landlord know prior to 30 days, but I'm not reading anything from Wisconsin that states I have to legally give 30 days notice. So, legally, does my landlord have a case against me?

I explained how I had a thyroidectomy and I would need medicine the rest of my life. I also said I just need the proper blood work to determine what MG of Levothyroxine I should take, and a prescription to make it happen. I even wrote all of this on my new patient sheet.

I demand the $115 I paid get credited to that, the accountants response is that they already paid the outsourced lab and cannot get the money back.

5b60e59dda52255c20d02f72,"Neighbor put an Olympic regulation shotgun skeet range in his backyard. As the title states my neighbor built a full-size Olympic regulation skeet range in his backyard. Overall I feel like there is a lot going on here but I'll try to keep it relatively succinct while giving context on everything.

I live in rural Shawnee County, KS. I bought my home in 2014 to get away from the city and have some peace, quiet, and space, and maybe have a few farm-style critters. Our home is on 3 acres. It was a delightfully quiet first winter in the new house. 

Late winter of 2015 a neighboring house and 15 acres went up for sale and quickly sold. The new neighbor is a kind man with a family. He stated that he planned to use his land for dirt bike trails and putting in a shotgun range for his son (who is, admittedly, quite a talented shooter). My dreams of a quiet rural home felt shattered. 

Within a few months he was running skid steers to flatten the plot, had dump truck loads of gravel brought out, built a high and low house for the target throwers, and put in concrete pads for the shooting stations. This is a full-on, permanent, Olympic regulation installation. In no time at all his son was out there shooting hundreds of shots a day practicing. Evenings on our back patio or deck were filled with the sound of shotgun practice. I did not want to be ""that neighbor"" so we just tolerated it, knowing the son would be moving to college within a couple years and the shooting would decrease.

Note that I also own and use firearms so I don't have anything inherently against their use. It's the fact that this is a permanently installed shooting range that I feel is detrimental to property values and disruptive to the ability of my family and all of our neighbors to enjoy our property. It has come to the point that I want it to go away. If we were to try to sell our house, I'm certain we'd have to disclose the neighbor's range. Can you imagine how limited our potential market would be? Who would want to buy a house next to that?

I looked into the zoning of our area (Rural Agricultural) and it lists ""Gun target and practice shooting ranges"" under ""Uses permitted by Conditional Use Permit."" However, his property is subdivided as single family residential. The publication which specifies a process for conditional use permits is [here](https://www.snco.us/planning/document/zoning_regulation_20131205_art_25.pdf) and references a procedure found [here](http://www.snco.us/planning/document/ZoningRegulationSec33.pdf). I don't know how that all works if the property is already set up as single family residential. I do know that I was never informed of any hearings or opportunities to provide my opinion on its use. He just did it.

The kicker here is he just listed his home for sale yesterday. I fear that there may be some sort of law that if properties neighboring his don't file a complaint or speak up about disruptive use within a certain period, or if a sale goes through, that we will have in effect agreed to its use and waive any right to complain. I also fear that the buyer may use it even more than the current owner did. 

I am about to head over to the county planning department to file a formal complaint about it and see if there is anything they can do. 

Does the Legal Advice community have any other suggestions? I just want to make sure that when the neighbor is gone, so is the shooting range.",0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25

Svetlana sent a cleaning lady to my apartment, we will call her Vera. Vera does a fantastic job, we like her a lot. She is very sweet and meek and deferential. She comes every other week or so as needed, we have a tiny apartment, she charges $60 and I add $10 as a tip for a total of $70, I make out a check to Vera directly every time she comes. She cleans the whole 550 sq. ft. apartment including the dishes.

Vera does not speak basically any English at all, so anything I have to say I have to communicate through Svetlana by text message. I have never met Viktor or Svetlana, but I text them to arrange cleaning or if I have some request for Vera. I have the suspicion that Svetlana may be a bit stern or mean to Vera.

This summer Vera started bringing her girls. The girls are out of school and are helping her clean. Usually I am not home when she comes, so I didn't notice at first, but I worked from home one morning and she had brought her daughter, and then another time I noticed that she has two daughters she sometimes brings. The girls are very sweet and always smiling and pleasant. 

I am not certain of the age of the girls, but they are both teenagers. The older one is probably 16-17, the younger may be 14-15.

- We like Vera and her girls a lot. I actually used to clean apartments myself when I was in college full-time and I can't imagine doing it as a single mother. She seems like a great mom with happy girls and we are not judging her or wanting to get her in trouble, I am confident that she is making the best choices she can for her girls. Whatever I do I do not want to make life harder for her or her girls.

- I don't know how old the girls are or if they are being compensated fairly. I can't ask Vera about this because she knows so little English she is nearly mute. I could ask Svetlana, but I don't know how much I trust Svetlana, I have never even met her.

- I have no idea how many hours a week the girls are working, I don't know how many homes Vera cleans. It seems she only brings her girls occasionally and only since the summer began, she brings the older one more often I think.

5b60e59dda52255c20d02fc5,"(IN) I renewed my lease because I was led to believe I could avoid the hassle of moving. Now, I am being force transferred to a new unit.. I have lived at my apartment since last August, with the lease expiring at the end of July. Once they started taking renewals, maybe around November, they really pushed on the theme of not moving. They posted fliers on everyone's door saying something like ""Avoid the cost of moving. Renew today!"" showing the costs of moving trucks, security deposits, etc. added up. Also, on their website, it encourages people to renew and says sign your lease to stay in your apartment for another year. Under the impression that I could avoid moving, I renewed my lease around early June.

Fast-forward to today, I get a call from the leasing office informing me that I will be force-transferred, so that they can consolidate units and turn my apartment. Their reasoning for doing this was that I was the only person in my four bedroom apartment to renew my lease. They want to move me to a different unit within the complex. I will get two weeks to clean my current unit and move my new stuff into my new assigned unit.

I live in California, and I purchased a new vehicle in Texas in April.  The dealership  said they would handle registering for me in California, that they had done this before.  Fast forward 2 months, a week before my temp tags were going to expire and I contact them asking what the status was, as my tags were about to expire. This prompted a flurry of emails which quickly became apparent, that they had dropped the ball with my paperwork and only just got started.  They issued me a new set of tags for another two months.*(which I question the legality of the new tags, since they have a purchase date displayed that doesn't match my paperwork, I assume because temp tags can only have a 2 month limit... But I digress, I hope I wont get pulled over by police and need to explain)* They also requested that I get my vehicle VIN inspected, and a smog check completed.  Upon getting those two things done, the VIN inspector told me I would need to get it weighed as well since it was a truck, so I got that done as well, and the dealership then told me that was needed afterall...  Good thing I was told by the VIN guy.

All additional paper work was sent a couple of weeks ago, which I followed up on multiple times.  All was quiet until yesterday when I receive an email from the finance director, who this particular individual I have had zero contact with up to this point.  

&gt;We have been notified by our titling agency that the State of California is requiring 
&gt;more in taxes to register your vehicle.  The amount that was used was calculated on 
&gt;the Base MSRP **as requested**, but California has calculated it using the Sale Price.
&gt;If you have any questions regarding this amount feel free to contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx
&gt; and I will do my best to assist you.

The above **as requested** line is the one I have an issue with, this sounds like they are trying to cover their butt, and it makes it sound as if I requested that they calculate the sales tax differently than they should have.  I did not make any such request, nor did I even know that they did that until yesterday.  April is a long time ago, and I thought all the financials were squared away.

The amount that I owe all of a sudden is not trivial, it is $1670.24.  That is a large mistake, one that I feel the dealership should take some responsibility for.  Do I have any recourse?  Should I expect the dealership to cover some or all of this?  What would be the proper approach to take in your opinion.

Is there any way I can sue him for back child support?. Long story short, when I was born, my father left my mother (both early 20s) because he didn't want me and wasn't ready to be a Dad. He wanted to keep partying, going to bars and living that lifestyle.

They were married when I was born, but shortly after, got a divorce.

My father was ordered to pay child support until I was 18, but he never did. My Mom was so busy working 2-3 shitty jobs to keep us stable and so upset with my Dad that she never had the time, willpower or resources to do anything about it. She just gave me the whole, ""He'll get his in the end."" speech about karma.

I haven't spoken to my father in over 15 years. Since my early teens.

Well, I'm older now and my adult mind can process what actually happened and I'm not okay with it. I'm 29 now and I was wondering if there is any way I can sue him and collect the money he never paid so I can try to force my Mom to take it. I know she's prideful, but I want to make things right because she still works those same shitty jobs as she did when I was younger and she deserves better than that.

Is there anything I can do legally about the back child support he never paid? I know he has it, because he **still** lives with his mother  (my grandmother), doesn't pay any bills, and my uncle (his brother) tells me that my Dad is into bad drugs and constantly bets thousands of dollars on stupid football games.

It's infuriating what he put my Mom through and I want justice. I'm just hoping that legal action doesn't have to come from my Mom, because I know she will just tell me to let it go like she did.

My grandfather passed three months ago, leaving a will that split the inheritance between his three daughters. He had $100,000 in checking and savings accounts, a house on 80 acres of land probably only worth about $150,000, and shares of stock worth another $90,000. He happened to tell my mother, sister, and I that the shares of stock were to be split between us, the two granddaughters. He happened to not mention this to his other two daughters, my aunts, one of whom is the executor, and it isn't in the will.

Regardless, everybody has agreed that we two granddaughters will get this money to honor his wishes, though my eldest aunt, the executor, believes that this will be extremely difficult. She has declined to hire a lawyer for help, and lives on the other side of the country. She seems to be showing signs of early dementia, and has difficulties performing the simplest of tasks, including filling out simple forms. We can't directly help her, because she is so far away, and she refuses to ""waste"" money on a lawyer, though she is blowing thousands of dollars a month (it has been three months so far) because the enormous lawn needs to be maintained at nearly $200/week, and utilities are still on because she hasn't turned them off, property taxes are ridiculous, and the stock and property values have been declining steadily. 

My mother and other non-executor aunt are frustrated, but at this point would rather give up the money than deal with their sister or bother with legal counsel. My sister and I are frustrated and could really use the money, but believe we have no legal recourse because we aren't formally in the will.

She is making zero progress on the estate and it is wasting money and preventing us from getting our inheritance. Is there anything my sister and I can do?

5b60e59dda52255c20d0306e,"[TX] My employment was recently terminated and they won't pay my commission.. Hi /r/legaladvice!

I have been working in a salon industry for a substantial amount of time and was even Assistant Manager at other salons I worked at. I recently moved home during my year off before grad school and I started working at a salon at the beginning of April. I told the owner that I would be leaving at the end of July to go to grad school which is why I refused a management position with his salon. During the interview I asked for a certain amount per hour and he increased the dollar amount without any provocation. I thought this was a great opportunity for me and I took the basic sales level position.


Upon starting my job I was given sales goals and was told (unlike many others) that as long as I hit my goal I would receive 10% commission. He handed me an employee handbook and as I started to read through it line by line the owner told me all I had to do was sign the last page. I told him that I just wanted to read through in case I needed to initial any part or if I had questions about a section. He instructed me that there was no other place to initial and that I don't have to read it because it was straight forward. He pressured me into signing the last page without being able to fully go over it and I was not given a copy of what I had signed despite me asking frequently for one. 

There weren't any problems in April or in May. I met all of my sales goals and was given my commission on the day it was promised. In early June I arrived at the salon location I was opening and found a letter he had left for me instructing that my hourly pay was now decreased by 20% with no mention of change in commission structure. The only other employees that received this letter were all going to school at the end of the summer but their letters stated specific hourly pay changes and changes in commission structure. Many employees quit but I decided to call the owner and alert him to the fact that I was promised at least a certain dollar amount per hour and it was his decision to increase it and now after the 20% decrease, I was below the amount I had asked for in my interview. He agreed and decided to bump my pay up to my requested amount in the interview. 

After this conversation took place, he then gave me a very high sales goal and put me at a salon that wasn't busy enough for me to meet it. However after a couple of weeks he and the scheduling manager began asking me if I could cover shifts at a busier store for other employees. After accepting the shifts I was now working full time (40hr/week) after just wanting to do a max of 30. On the final day of June I ended up selling $1300+ for the busy salon and surpassed my sales goal by $9. July 1st was the end of the week and I was already clocking in 40+ hours when I asked if I could go home early since the salon died down. There were multiple employees there who could have taken care of our clients. The assistant manager told me that it was ""ok for me to leave 1 hour early"" considering I had to go to a second job that night. The salon was closed Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday for 4th of July. On Wednesday I was scheduled for 11 hours, Thursday for 12 hours, and Friday for 11 hours. On Wednesday I had worked all day and did not take a break. I saw that we were slowing down at the end of the day and when another assistant manager came in to close (who would've taken all the appointments anyway thus leaving me with nothing to do) told me that I could leave early again since there were no clients coming in and I had already been there for 10 hours. I went home and heard nothing.

I came in on Thursday fully intending to work my 12 hour shift because Thursdays are very busy and I knew they would need help. I worked non stop without a break until 5pm when the owner (whom I haven't seen in days) comes in and hands me a letter that he is terminating my employment due to ""excessive absenteeism without the approval of a supervisor"". I was livid. I initialed the document that said that I did not agree with the terms on which I was being terminated and left. 

He is supposed to be paying out commission this week and I'm afraid he won't give it to me because a co-worker sent me a copy of the employee handbook which states on the last page that if you are terminated you are not entitled to you commission. I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here. Clearly I was forced to sign a document in front of him and I wasn't able to read anything from it because he never sent me a copy and I feel like he took advantage of this situation because he clearly gave me a sales goal that I wasn't supposed to meet last month but I did and I feel like he's worming his way out of paying my commission. He knew that I would be giving my two weeks at the end of this week (after I was supposed to get my commission check) and I feel like he tried to beat me to the punch. I have NEVER been in trouble at this job and I know that he can terminate employment for whatever reason but I feel like I worked for free essentially. This commission check was supposed to be $500+ and help me for school.

TLDR; Was given a huge sales goal last month that wasn't intended to be reached. Surpassed the goal and the owner terminated my employment for things that were approved of by supervisors. Now I fear he won't pay me my commission due to an employee handbook he forced me to sign without reading.",,,,,,,,0.25,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75

I do not have family in the USA and don't have established residency in any state.

However, I feel like I'm currently too young to get married and will probably be aiming to get married in 2-4 years.  I will be moving home to Hong Kong this year whilst he will be staying in the UK to finish the final year in his degree.

We are looking into him getting a masters in the USA as we know some masters courses allow their graduates to stay in the country to find work for the next 3 years but we know that chances of scholarships are slim. 


2) I have read about how it is easier to get the marriage green card if he was already in the states at the time. Would him not being in the USA when applying for the green card/visa be a detriment?


3) Is it possible to get a marriage visa/green card if we got married outside of the USA and **both** parties are not present in the USA at the time of the application and will this affect his ability to enter the country? 


4) My partner also wants to know if it's possible for him to eventually get a dual citizenship between UK/USA?

We are just very confused as to how the whole process of immigration works and the requirements for it.

5b60e59dda52255c20d0310b,"Nissan Dealership never grounded my car and impacting my credit - Help Please. Hi all, I am not sure if this is the right forum, but I need some advice on how to resolve my situation. I apologize for the length here.
I traded in my current 2014 Nissan Altima lease on January 28, 2017, two months before the lease was due for a 2017 Nissan Altima, which I was required to make a payment of $397 on the day of trade. I spent over 6 hours at the dealership, at which time they indicated they had the car I wanted, but it would have to be driven in from downtown Los Angeles, I live in South Bay California. The dealer indicated it would only take an hour and be done before I was done my finance paperwork. I met with the finance dealer, we signed all paperwork, I gave him copies of my registration and proof of car insurance for the 2014 Nissan Altima. After my meeting, I was told the car would be another hour or two, I asked since I signed the paperwork, could they come by my house since I live two miles away, the dealer nicely obliged. Around 7:00pm that night, the salesman showed up with my car, which we exchanged keys and gave me what appeared to be my paperwork.
Fast forward a few weeks, I noticed I had two Nissan Finance accounts, one for my 2014 and one for my 2017. The 2014 had one payment remaining of $355 and I called Nissan Finance at which time I was told likely the “grounding paperwork” is still in process and not to worry. I immediately called the dealership and asked what is going on and was assured the paperwork is in process. Over the course of the next four months, I worked with the General Manager of the dealership and Nissan Finance (both refuse to work together) and the paperwork had not been filed to date. Last month I checked my credit, which had dropped from 815 to 750, then this month it dropped from 750 to 680 due to 150 day late payment on my 2014 Nissan Altima. Finally the dealership got paperwork together, backdated the contract and paperwork to January 28th (so they say) and paid off all fines, penalties, and payments related to the 2014 Nissan Altima.
The kicker, Nissan Finance has refused to remove the late payments from my credit report as the Nissan dealership did not provide them any letter stating responsibility for the lateness of the payments as a fault of their own. The dealership refused to accept my calls or emails or my showing up on site. I have contacted an attorney and been told I should start arbitration, but I will need to figure out a monetary number for which my credit was impacted. I have also contacted the state of California Attorney General, Better Business Bureau and filed complaints on Yelp and Google.
I have over 40 documented phone calls to the Nissan Dealer and multiple site visits. Nissan Consumer Affairs told me it is not their problem as well as Nissan Finance. I really do not know what to do here anymore, do I go ahead with arbitration? My friend was with me when I turned my car over to the salesman. Is there any help that I have emails with the dealership admitting fault for the incident and admitting it would be “taken care of”. Nissan Finance nor the dealership will give me proof payment was made except confirming on the phone I no longer owe anything on the 2014 Nissan Altima.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03125,"Company is using mandated lunch break time for meetings and not giving another break. Hey Reddit,

So a friend of mine works as a cook in some big sort of conference center thingy.  Before getting into the issue at hand I want to preface that we are from California and there are established laws in our state regarding mandatory meal breaks.

Ok so onto what is going on.  My friend has told me that on several occasions, employees have been required to attend meetings during their lunch period.  They cannot bring food into this meeting and they are not given any other time during the day to eat.  I know in California, it is required that you receive a 30 minute meal break after 5 hours of work unless a shift is only 6 hours.  From what I understand, the company sometimes works around this by making employees clock out early yet not actually take a break, so that on paper they appear to be getting their break and then having them take the break much later in the day.

The final issue I was curious about, is that apparently, said company is counting restroom breaks as the employee's 10s and 15s.  And im not talking about a lengthy bathroom break.  From what I am being told, if nature calls and you arent on break, you use your break.  So if you need to pee and it takes 3 minutes, say goodbye to your 10 minute break.

Any help or comments on the legality of these practices is appreciated.  From what I understand, her division doesnt really have any HR to go to, just an office manager with no real power over how things go.

5b60e59dda52255c20d031b2,"Property management company trying to screw us?. So where do I begin? My partner and I lived in an apartment(in St. Louis, Missouri) for 3 years and moved out the first of this month.

There are plenty of details that may or may not be relevant, but I decided to just include the history of our stay there, in case it could be of use. 

Timeline of events:

July 2014 - Signed a lease with first property management company. Simple and straightforward, was done almost entirely online. He tells me to take some pictures of damage and email it to him if I want some repairs. I take *some* pictures, but not in detail. I ask about repairs, but only get little fixes here and there. They clearly were not that invested in the property, but I was okay with it because the rent was cheap.

Fall 2015 - Water main broke, landlord(owner) has to pay for everything. We were without water for a week, but compensated.

Summer 2016 - Property management company lets me know the house is up for sale. He said this doesn't have to change anything for me. He said we can sign a lease as usual, and that is what we did. Same lease as before, just different dates. Business as usual. Soon enough we get a letter from a different property management company (with their address, phone number, etc). I want to repeat that I did not sign a lease with them, it was the first company, but I assume they just took over the lease. I looked up the company's reviews online, and they have terrible ratings. Awful. From this moment on, I've only conversed with one person at the office about repairs, I've had no other contact with any of the people from the company besides a repairman. They did not see the apartment or speak with me.


Early 2017 - We ask for window sill repairs(they had been rotting out for some time). This is something that we bugged the other property management company about, but nothing happened. A repairman did come over, but they did a pretty crappy patch job... This is when we were thinking it might be a good idea to move this summer. 

Summer 2017- In the middle of June, we find out we're approved to move into the apartment we've been looking at. I was concerned about the require notice to vacate before this, so I looked it up online and could only find a 30 day requirement for month-to-month rentals and leases without a fixed end date. Our lease has a fixed end date. Nowhere on our lease does it state that the property management company needs to be notified that we are moving out. It is around a week before our lease was up that we emailed the property management company about our intention to leave, and information about how to get a hold of us.

Yesterday - We get an email back from the company, they seem confused. They say ""do you mean you are leaving at the end of this month?"" We email back and explain ""no we left at the end of last month, that is when our lease was up."" In response, they said they needed a 30 day notice, that it is state law. Now, I had zero knowledge of this. Nothing in the lease. Nothing I could find online said this is true. We haven't responded.

I included lots of info about repairs, and their lack of understanding of the property, because I think these guys are indeed very sketchy, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they try to withhold our deposit or even try to charge us for damages that were already there. These folks make me nervous.

One time I was in Ocean City, MD and that is a notorious party zone during ""senior week."" My friends and I were about 24 and long out of high school and not there to party at all, just to maybe drink a few and hit the sack afterwards. 

Anyways, My girlfriend and I rented the room and my four friends who were with me rented another right next to mine. They came over to hang out before bed and it was a total of 6 people in my room. The hotel manager/desk clerk showed up about a half hour later demanding to come in my room. He was accusing me of hiding a large group of people out on the balcony and was very adamant that I was lying to him. I declined over and over stating that I had a few friends over from next door and that there were only two people on the balcony smoking cigarettes and we were being quiet and getting ready for bed. He pushed me aside and burst into the room, looked in the bathroom and found nothing, then he went out onto the deck and saw I didn't, in fact, have a huge party, but saw that I was telling the truth. He apologized a few times and explained he's had many rooms destroyed in the past few years because of partyers and then he left.

I signed a lease stating that I was to move in to the apartment on July 8th (I signed about three weeks before this date) and would receive a copy of the lease on the move in date. Relying on that agreement, I arrived July 8th and gave the leasing agent the cashier's check for $735.48 and received the keys to the apartment so that I could begin to move my belongings into the apartment. I did not get a copy of the lease, the reason they said was because the manager was not there to sign it. I had recruited the help of several friends to help me move the larger furniture. When I went to the apartment there were several issues:

The newly installed shower was not finished. 
Neither of the two smoke detectors were functional. 
There was a large crack in the sliding glass window. 
The carpets had not been cleaned in any way. 
There was a severe infestation with pests in the kitchen.
After speaking with the leasing agent I was told that the carpets should have been cleaned, shower finished, and apartment sprayed for pests. They informed me that they would call the cleaning company to clean the apartment that night (July 8th) and that I would have to wait to move in the next day (July 9th) so that the carpets could dry. The assistant manager offered a concession equivalent to the prorated rent for July 8th and 9th and informed me the manager was not going to be in until Monday (July 10th). 

On July 9th I returned to move in and I found the apartment in the same condition, it had not been cleaned and none of the issues had been addressed.

The morning of July 10th I returned to the apartment complex at 9:00am to speak to the manager, meaning I had to go into work late to be able to talk to her. She told me that the apartment would be cleaned that day and I could move in later that day. The people I had recruited to help me were not able to help me move July 10th, I had a work obligation today (July 11th) and will be out of town the remainder of the week until the morning of July 17th, making that the earliest possible date I could move in (if I am able to get help from friends).

The manager offered concession of rent from July 8th until the date I move in but said they would not pay for movers despite the fact that I had help lined up to move the weekend we had agreed I would be moving in and now have no help to move. Are they legally obligated to cover moving costs for me due to me having to hire movers because they were the ones to breach the contract?

In my search for jobs that suit my skill-set, I found a position identical to mine at a direct competitor. It is at a huge organisation, *pays 1.5x the salary*, and offers more opportunity to grow in my career. To be honest it's a dream job. 

After interviewing, I'm optimistic that I'll get an offer in the next week or so. However his got me thinking about non-compete, considering we make essentially the exact same product for the same broad market.

**About my contract**:
The clauses in my employment contract very clearly **prohibit me from dealing with any customer, employee, third party or business for 6 months after termination or divulging any trade secrets or confidential information.** The terms are really broad but very clear. *There is a 3 month prohibition on being involved with 'any business concern' in competition.*

I could go on 'garden leave' for 3 months but it is extremely unlikely my potential employer would wait that long.

In terms of 'trade secrets,' I know the company's financials *roughly*, and information about the number of customers we have. I don't know if they count as trade secrets.

* How serious is this?
* Do I just go ahead and hope nothing comes of it?
* Is there a legal way to go around this?

5b60e59dda52255c20d03262,"Breaking lease over faulty/insufficient AC unit [US, KS]. In my apartment, maintenance has been out a few times to fix the AC. As it stands, midwest summer has kicked into full gear and it's not unusual for my apartment to exceed 80 degrees, occasionally getting to the upper eighties at peak heat. While I work in hot environments and so have built up a resistance to the heat, I have a 10 month old who is having more trouble with it. A quick googling shows that most experts say infants should be kept at about 72 degrees when sleeping, so getting above eighty seems to be not recommended. It's especially bad at night, when he is sleeping, as even then the apartment stays around eighty and keeps him fairly restless.

My question is, under Kansas law, when does this become an unlivable residence and I can lawfully break the lease? My research is showing these things to be a bit obtuse, and I'm not sure if having a young child in the apartment makes any difference. I've been more or less told that the AC is working as hard as it can and that there's just not much more that can be done. Am in good standing with the landlord, if that helps the legal situation at all.

I hate to make a post about this because I realize it seems somewhat insignificant but /r/makeupaddiction said I should post here instead.

I have a very large lipstick collection, but I keep it organized and make sure everything is in its place. I left for the weekend and my drawer had everything in it, but when I returned I noticed my lipsticks took up significantly less space than they used to, and then noticed a couple of my lipsticks were missing. Some that I'd never even taken out. Then I noticed another missing. Then I took out the drawer and sat down to evaluate-- NINE in total were missing. Some of them my very favorite ones. At 20 bucks each, this sets me back $180.

The only person that had been in this house other than my grandmother was her maid. The only obvious answer to this was that her maid stole my lipsticks. I can't come up with any other solution. Mind you, my grandmother loves her maid. So when I told her about this she refused to believe me-- she called me crazy and that I just lost them all and don't talk to her about this. I'm not even allowed to ask her maid about it.

I cannot afford to replace this stuff. I'm a student on basically minimum wage and I built up my collection over a long period of time. 20 dollars is a big deal to me. And now I have to drop 180 on stuff I already owned? Because someone felt that they could just have a party with my stuff and get away with it?

I need to get those lipsticks back. She's coming back tomorrow morning and I was thinking about confronting her in the driveway before she went in. Thing is, no one is going to admit to stealing. My grandmother would probably kick me out if I got her fired (even though she deserves it), so I was thinking about contacting her agency but I don't really know. How do I best confront her in a way that will maybe get my belongings back? I can't stand the thought of her getting away with this. I'm absolutely devastated.

5b60e59dda52255c20d0328a,"(IL) sublessee took rent money from new sublessee and has not paid rent.. A couple months back I subletted a room in my apartment after my roommate needed to move out. Both the original roommate and me are on the lease, which ends August 1st. Because of the short notice, I found someone on a facebook roommate search group (I will refer to him as FR for former roommate). I spoke to the landlord, who requested an application and background check from FR, which was given to him. I asked about writing up my own sublease, but was told not to worry about it, that the landlord would prefer to write one up himself. To my knowledge he never got around to writing up the sublease. 

About three weeks back, FR told me he got a temporary job in another city and would need to leave that weekend. He said he would have the rent, but would likely look for a sublet for his sublet. A couple days later he found someone (who I will refer to as NR for new roommate), who started moving in the next day. I asked FR if he had been in contact with the landlord, which he said he had. I talked to the landlord, it turned out he had not. The landlord made it clear that the NR should not have moved in without his consent, but was willing to organize getting the application from him and work it out.  NR was oblivious to all this, but when told of the situation was quick to get all necessary documents to the landlord. 

The day before rent was due I organized with FR to drop off rent. I learned from NR that FR had collected rent money from him and was planning to hand it to me, so that I could give it to the landlord. FR claimed to be busy, so we organized for the next day. FR kept pushing the time back for when he’d drop off rent; I offered to pick it up, but he rejected the offer. When the landlord showed up to pick up rent, I apologized that FR had not showed up yet, to which the landlord informed me that FR told him I would be covering the rent in full. We were confused, but figured it could be a miscommunication and scheduled for the next day. At that point, I learned from NR that he had been told that the rent had already been paid. FR did not show up the next day either. 

It is about a week later, and FR has made multiple excuses and has not shown up at any time he has told us that he would to drop off rent. I have asked him to send it to me via an app, but he claims that he cannot deposit the money because it is in cash and he does not have a local bank. I learned from NR that FR took $160 more than the cost of rent and insisted he give it to him in cash. It is apparent from the multiple discrepancies that FR does not plan on paying rent or returning the money that NR gave him. Luckily NR, the landlord, and I have been in full cooperation with one another, and have text messages citing the discrepancies in what FR has told us. The landlord suggested NR go to the police to file a report for the money that was taken, but the police informed us they could not do anything and this would need to be settled in civil court.

My question is what can we do about this situation? What rights do FR, NR, the landlord, and I have? I don’t have much hope for myself having any legal footing in terms of my own rights in this situation. I realize as the leaseholder, I am responsible for full rent. Unfortunately I won’t have the funds to cover the full rent until the end of the month, and will likely need to cover this with the deposit. How severely will this affect my ability to rent apartments in the future? Does NR have a case for fraud in civil court? How can the landlord and I support him in this? Also, FR has left some things in the apartment, and has attempted to get them back. What are his rights in terms of the things left behind?",,,,,,,,0.25,,,,,,,,,,,,

5b60e59dda52255c20d0335d,"[UNITED KINGDOM] How to prove somebody is forging my signature?. Hello! First of all, I am aware of UK legal advice but this thread has far more followers, hence why I decided to post here. It's more on behalf of my partner, but I will explain as much as I can. 

My SO and his ex have not been together for about 3 years. They have a toddler son together. Something recently came up, where she turned a bit psycho and is currently trying to upset my partner, lets call him B, by denying access. But that is a different story I will not get into. 

When B left her house 3 years ago, he agreed to stay on the tenancy agreement so she wouldn't lose her flat as she was only working part time and had his son full time. They have a family arranged agreement where he sees his son two days a week, picks him up on Monday morning and drops him off on Wednesday morning. He has done this for three years without a single exception, as well as extra days.  
As this whole denying access thing happened, B decided that he wants out of the tenancy agreement as he has been aware she is breaking certain rules, such as: 
- She is a regular weed smoker and he has proof of catching her out on two different occasions over text, one is leaving a full grinder on the bedside as her son slept in that bed, and second time the communal area and her flat stank of weed as he picked his son up, and she tried making excuses that it was from last night as she smoked out of the window. So in her flat agreement, it says she will be evicted if there is drug use on the premises. I just wanna add, do not question me why we both allowed that and let it slide, as that's completely another matter I don't want to go into. 
- Secondly, she has a fella who pretty much lives there, everytime he picked his son up, his truck was there even on odd days like Sundays. However, we cannot prove that, but it's illegal to have tenants who don't appear on the agreement live with you full time. 

So as B rang the agent and asked to be taken off, she passed him onto a colleague who said that unfortunately, there are rent arrears of a total of £900, which he knew nothing about, but until that's settled, he cannot take himself off, unless he refuses to pay, but gets a CCJ in return. And obviously, if she finds out he's trying to get out, she will not cooperate and pay. He made the agent aware of her breaking the tenancy agreement and she suggested making a case with the police about the drug use. 

After a whole day of thinking, I asked him when was the last time you signed anything to do with her flat and he said over three years ago and he's pretty sure it was a 6 month contract. Usually, both tenants have to sign a new contract at least once a year, so how did she do it? Most likely forged his signature and as well as that, she racked up debt in his name, which is a crime. So right now, that's our leg to stand on. 

He has proof that for the last three years he lived under his current address, but we aren't sure if that cuts it, but surely if we were able to prove that his signature has been forged, the contract is invalid what means he can remove himself from the agreement? How do we deal with this? 

We are seeing a solicitor tomorrow morning for one hour, but really that's the only legal advice we can afford, this one off time.

5b60e59dda52255c20d0337c,"Neighbors dog broke the fence and killed my dog. WA. So this morning I woke up and let my 2 dogs out to go potty. They are both very small dogs, a chihuahua and a yorkie. I went back upstairs to get ready for work when I heard what I thought to be my two dogs fighting with each other.


So I came downstairs again, holding my 8 month old this time  and checked my back yard. This is when I saw the neighbors dog had my chihuahua in its mouth by the belly and was flinging her around. 


I yelled for my husband to come down , he opened the door and the dog ran into their property through the hole he had made in the fence. 


I didn't initially open the door since I didn't want him to charge at me while I was holding my daughter.  My husband then told me to call the police while he tended to our dog who could barely even move. 

When the police officer arrived he was really mad. He said he has had calls about these neighbors multiple times for their dog. It is illegal to own a Pitbull in our county. And he said they cited them multiple times for it. He took our statements and went to speak with them. He took their dog in his patrol car.


The officers gook pictures of the fence, my dog and theirs. I did as well. 


We took my dog to the vet and she passed away a few hours later.  I called the officer to let him know so that he may add it to his report.


I am not sure what our next step should be. I am worried about retaliation from them since they have caused problems before. 


We have our suspicions about the death of our other chihuahua, and we think they might have fed her marijuana. The vet said she had died of marijuana poisoning (?). No one in our house smokes, but we know that they do since they do it in their front porch often.  

It is too late to do anything about that but I feel they will try to hurt our other dog since this happened. We plan on getting cameras to monitor the back yard. 


The officer suggested I take them to court over the vet bills (this was before our dog died). I don't know how any of that works.

In a couple of years the plan is to buy a house in Oregon with my SO of 7 years. We are not married and do not plan to marry for various reasons, but we’ve lived together for 3 years now while renting. I would like to discuss getting a cohabitation agreement once we're going to get serious about purchasing a home together that essentially states what will happen with the house/mortgage should we decide to split. I'm much less concerned with the household expenses being drawn out and split up line by line, we already handle all that well as renters.

My question is this: is there a way to specify who can or can’t live with us in the house in these kinds of agreements? I do not want either of our in-laws living with us unless it is due to a verifiable terminal illness that requires hospice or end-of-life care. I realize this makes me sound like a heartless jerk, but I have a myriad of reasons to believe my SO’s mother will attempt to manipulate him or other family members in order to coerce him into supporting her financially and emotionally, i.e. living with us. I’m willing to include my own family in the agreement too. 

I don’t know if this is a thing or not, or if anyone has gone through something similar. I was thinking that there could be some kind of stipulation that if a family member does have to live with us temporarily, it has a maximum time limit where they must find a new place to live or we will pick it for them, something to that effect. 

Any help or direction or clarification on what could be done in this case would be awesome help. I realize that having this conversation with my SO is going to be uncomfortable and awkward, but I’m really looking to see what are realistic options that I can bring to the table. I’d also consider anything along the lines of “if you don’t like/trust his family, don’t buy a house with him” generally unhelpful and not what I’m looking for.

* The safe is in my room

* I never take my money out of the safe and the safe stays in my room so there is no way I would have misplaced the money, I know when I have opened the safe, and the last time I opened it everything was there.

* The only people that knew about the location of my safe was a few of my closest friends 

* I have searched my house to see if my money was anywhere just in case

* the key to the safe was on my keychain which was next to me while I slept in my room

*  No one broke into my house or has otherwise had any unsupervised access to my room, the only time when the theft could have happened was while I slept after the party

* Me and my friends are all 17

There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while.

They provided me with their contact and insurance information.

I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.

This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.

When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?

Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.

Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.

I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.

I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.

At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.

I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)

It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.

It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out. 

Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor. 

The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily. 

I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.

I live in an apartment complex with a lot of cigarette smokers.  I am highly allergic to cigarette smoke (been to the ER, multiple doctors, prescribed inhalers, EPI-pens, etc.)  The number of smokers has gotten much worse in the last few years, and it is negatively impacting my health to a serious degree.

I'm a 19 y/o male college student, and I was arrested a week ago while sitting in my car in a neighborhood near my house (I was alone). Cops searched my car and found my mason jar, which contained:
 - ~14 grams of marijuana (in two different bags)
 - A pea-sized amount of wax (hashish), with a paperclip
 - A grinder
 - 3 packs of rolling papers
 - A small bag of tobacco
 - A paintbrush that smelled of marijuana (I used it to clean my grinder)

I stupidly lied to my arresting officer when he initially asked if I had drugs in the car, they searched my car with probable cause, and after that I was cooperative. The cop asked ""why did you lie to me?"" then said ""Nevermind you don't have to answer that"" so I never admitted to having knowledge of the marijuana (not that it matters.. I was my car).  Also, I had not been smoking that day, and the officers knew that (they let me drive my car home after they booked me), so DUI isn't an issue.

I was charged with a misdemeanor. I have already hired a lawyer, and he contacted my arresting officer, and the officer agreed to bring it down to a disorderly conduct. But, my lawyer said I was going to have trouble getting the District Attorney to agree to that due to the amount and the wax/rolling papers.

Property owner found me and said he was going to file trespassing charges, but he (likely) doesn't have any info besides my license plate. Drove away without any further interaction.

Full version: I was driving late at night following my GPS, and went down a dirt road. I was eventually lead to a point where the county road turned into a private road on a large ranch. It was pretty clearly marked no tresspassing, but it was ungated and looked like the shortest route to the highway I needed to get to (yes, I know I'm a dumbass for not turning around.) I drove down the road, but eventually came to a point where my puny sedan got stuck on the rocky dirt road. With no way out, I called roadside assistance. They had a lot of trouble finding me, owing to the fact that I was not on a publicly marked road. The driver that was coming to winch me out eventually found the property entrance, and apparently encountered the property owner. I don't know exactly what was said between them, but eventually the property owner drove the RA driver to me in his truck. The property owner gets out and informs me that he's going to file tresspassing charges while the RA looks at my car. Property owner then takes the RA back without saying anything else, or asking me anything. RA comes back with his truck, winches my car out, and I drive off the property without ever seeing the property owner again. I'm pretty sure the only info the property owner could have about me is my license plate. It's *possible* the RA gave him my name. I doubt it, but I didn't think to ask to be sure.

We just received a certified letter from our rental company stating that our payment was ""dishonored by [my] financial institution."" They are now demanding an additional ~$150 in fees. When we called the number on the letter, we were prompted to leave a voicemail. I left my details along with the confirmation number we had received with the payment confirmation email. We then contacted the customer service for the rental company and the rep stated that it had been denied for ""insufficient funds"" while the website states it was denied for ""closed account.""  

 1) I have $800 in privilege pay, so if I hadn't had the funds (I did), my checking account would have gone negative to pay the rent.  

2) The website deleted our saved account information so I cannot even verify the account number I used to make the transaction. All I have is the last 4 of my account number per the confirmation email, which I verified is correct.  

3) The letter demands these fees be paid within 12 days or we will be taken to court. While we can pay these fees, this is not our error as we had the confirmation email stating the payment was made.   

4) My checking account does NOT reflect that any attempt to retrieve the funds was made, however. I called to confirm this and the rental company didn't pull out any money. The funds are still sitting there.    

5) No one called us to state there was an issue with the payment. We assumed all was well as we had the confirmation email and figured it would take the typical 3-4 business days. I reasoned that with the holiday last week, things would be delayed a bit.  

6) We used my checking account for the first time instead of my fiancé's (his has never had any issue before). This is the only difference, but it still made us input the account number twice and routing number once when we entered the information initially.

Here goes nothing, I guess. 


So, my dad recently claimed his tax returns but was denied compensation because he has a standing order for custody for my siblings an I from January of this year. 


You see, my parents have been divorced for almost 5 years now and my siblings and I have been living with my father since 2013. However, even though my parents have been divorced some time now, my mother has always had custody even though we have been living with my father for the past 4 years. 


When my dad filed his tax return and claimed us the first time around, the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) quickly denied it and requested for proof of us living with him in which he provided them with proof and sent them documents. And now we are here. Rejected once more because of a court order my dad has for custody.


At this point we are both puzzled and unsure on what to do next. Every time we speak with the lawyer he requests money; which we do not have, unfortunately. I believe that he should get his money. It is not fair. We have been living with him for 4 years. Even if he did not have custody he should still be able to claim us on his taxes and get his hard earned money.

Several weeks ago we noticed evidence of mice in one of out bathrooms.  We thoroughly cleaned the droppings, notified the property manager, and 3-4 days later an exterminator came and sealed the holes in the wall where the mice were getting in.  Last week, we noticed new evidence of mice in our kitchen.  We notified the property manager again, and they came out and did a more thorough inspection to find that mice are chewing holes in our kitchen, both bathrooms, and the bedroom where our 2 year old sleeps.  We want to break the lease, the complex wants us to give 60 days notice and pay an additional 2 months after we move out.  Even if they fill all these holes, the building has a larger mouse problem and the rodents problem will persist.  

I am arguing that they did not comply with the NC General Statute 42-42: Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.  There is also an 'imminent danger' clause that specifies a rat infestation, but nothing about mice.

However, they discovered that my house doesn't sit 18 inches above the ground, so they will likely need to do a big of digging to make sure the foundation in the damaged area meets code, and the insurance company won't cover asbestoes abatement to cover the cost of removing asbestos discovered in the walls.  
   
I'm aware that I can file a claim through my insurance company, who will likely cover everything in full, minus my deductible, but I personally don't feel like I should have to shell out a dime to fix damages caused by someone else. 
  
I'm considering engaging an attorney to sue the fruit company for the difference.

I recently broke my lease and moved out of my house after about 9 to 10 months because the house had so many problems and the landlord refused to fix them.  The landlord actually agreed to terminate the lease early without penalty.  However, the landlord notified us that she's keeping our $4000 security deposit and sent a long itemized list of all kinds of repairs she made to the house with a blanket labor cost of $50/hr.  She charged the same labor cost for cleaning windows as she did for refinishing an antique wood vanity...  Although we've requested it, she has not provided any invoices or receipts for any of these repairs.  It seems that she just created a spreadsheet and assigned random dollar values and labor times/costs to all of these repairs, and possibly did them herself if they happened at all.  (The damages she says we're responsible for are completely outrageous considering we lived in the house for less than a year and are very tidy people, but that's beside the point of this post)  She also charged us $520 in locksmithing fees because she moved to New York with her only spare key and needed to hire a locksmith for her friend to show the house to potential tenants, but our lease stated to lock the keys in the house on move out.

The host and I got along well enough at first, but she is far more germaphobic and detail-oriented than I. She has a long list of very minor rules (e.g. close the shower curtain when it's not in use), and I failed to comply with a few of them. They were innocent mistakes and no actual damage was done to her property or the apartment, but the Airbnb policy does allow her to cancel the stay if I fail to follow her rules. She's also not obligated to refund me anything less than 30 days after the cancellation. I am not disputing that she is within her contractual rights to do this.

I politely requested she at least put the room back up on Airbnb and refund me the remaining rent if she finds a replacement. She adamantly refused, saying that because she's not in the wrong she doesn't need to do anything like that and can just keep my rent. Is she required to take steps to mitigate my losses here? There were 3 weeks left in the agreement, which comes out to over a thousand dollars in rent. I understand I can't demand an outright refund, but is she required to at least put the room back up for rent and pay me back what she can if she finds a replacement?

5b60e59dda52255c20d035ad,"Is it legal to charge a missed appointment fee even though I cancelled in advance?. Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, and also- throwaway because I'm paranoid.

I had an appointment with my regular podiatrist back in June. I've been a patient for years and have never missed an appointment. The doctor is very well-respected in our area and is booked out months in advance. 

On Thursday, June 8th, I got an email at 4:45 PM stating I had an appointment on Monday, June 12th at 1:45 PM. There was not an option to cancel the appointment from the email, so I called the next day, June 9th to cancel my appointment. The time of my call was 1:52 PM. When I spoke with the woman on the phone, I told her I had to cancel my appointment for Monday. She went ahead and cancelled it.

A couple of weeks ago, I received a bill from the doctors office for $35 for a ""missed appointment fee"". I called the office to remind them that I did in fact call, and I would be happy to being in a copy of my phone records to show I spoke with someone. The lady said because I called at 1:52 and not 1:45, I was outside of the 24-hour business day window so I had to be assessed a fee. 

There was absolutely nothing in writing saying that I had to cancel 24 hours in advance, Not only that, but the same woman who I've been speaking with on the phone didn't inform me on Friday (when I called to cancel) that I would have to pay a fee regardless because I was outside of that window. Why would by bill say missed appointment fee instead of late-cancellation fee? The only conclusion I could come up with is that she dropped the ball on her end and now I'm left 

The office wont budge and I fear that this will end up in collections. It's a small amount, but it's twice what my copay would have been and I literally live paycheck to paycheck, on the penny. I don't know what else I can do from here. Is there a way to dispute it without going through the office?",,,,,,,,0.25,,,,,,,,,,,,

5b60e59dda52255c20d0363f,"Tennants in common, one person wants us to buy her out and we cannot afford it, what can we do?. My family is part of a 'tennants in common' summer house. It was first owned by my mother's aunt who passed away and gave it equally to her family. There are seven 'shares' and for those that don't know, tennants in common mean that each of us own it 100% equally.

The shares were first divided as: 

My mom (M) =1.5 shares

Sister 1 (S1) = 1.5 shares

Sister (S2) = 1 share
 
Aunt1 (A1)= 1 share

Aunt2 (A2) (has 2 shares after her brother died)

1. Aunt2 is also the 'head' leader with everything in her name because she was the closest to the house, had the time and energy to run the bills and we all paid the bills to her and she was so brilliant with everything running smoothly.

2. Aunt2 has developed Alzheimers and is now being taken care of by Aunt1. Legally, everything has been turned over to Aunt1 since she is the primary caretaker.

3. Aunt1 is going through legal troubles (a foundation company accidentally did something to her basement and caused her house to collapse, so she's in that legal battle that may not be over for a couple years and she is literally living off of Aunt2's money (who was always very good at managing her money and has quite a nice amount).

4. She also recently divorced JUST before her house collapse and was old fashioned and never had to work before, so now that she's in her 60s she isn't exactly able too. So she doesn't really know how to get money except from sueing everyone. she's stressed out from taking care of Aunt2 full time, and has finally reached a breaking point that she no longer wants part of this precious house that we all own. So she has decided to sell it/ make us buy her out or-else.

5. Because Aunt1  is legally in charge of Aunt2, that also means she technically has 3 shares. So she's trying to make us buy out all three shares even though the rest of us desperately want to keep this. It's been in our family for almost a century. Aunt2 is unfortunately so far gone that she cannot understand what is going on and can't stop her.

We have been battling this issue since last summer and we are truly worried we might actually lose this house, despite four shares  wanting to 100% keep it. My twin and I were both proposed to there, my big sister was married there, and we've had so much life lived there that we all want to do anythig to keep it, we can't afford the $50k x 3, for those shares.

I'm not even sure where to begin… My friend is 19 and a completely disabled quadriplegic, his mother is his full-time caregiver, but she has become very estranged to her husband (yes they are still married) and they lived under the same roof up until recently. My friend has three younger siblings, all of whom were just taken by the dad to another town and he won't disclose where they are staying. The mom called the police and they said they can't do anything unless there are court documents filed. Isn't this kidnapping? Since he has taken them, they have come back to the house couple times, but only for a couple hours.
  
One of the biggest problems is that the mom is my friend's full-time caregiver and is completely dependent on the dad to pay bills and take care of things financially, but he doesn't include her on any of the financial information. This makes finding a legitimate lawyer very difficult. There is a lot more to this whole situation, including years of manipulation and mental abuse. It seems his main goal is to discredit her and threaten her with getting full custody of the kids and making her out to be the bad guy. It sounds like he has been able to turn the three youngest kids against her and is using money and gifts to manipulate them. The mom has no idea where the dad is getting the money to afford a second home or these gifts (including a car), especially because the dad recently put the family on Medicaid and food stamps.

5b60e59dda52255c20d036f2,"[CA] I've moved out of an apartment, found someone to sublet, but still being harassed by roommates living in the apartment.. Hi all, this is going to be a bit long but I was hoping if I could gain some advice and tips.

On September 1, 2016, I've moved into an apartment with 4 other girls (R, H, N, and S). Four of us signed the lease, S couldn't sign the lease since the floor plan technically only allowed 4 people to live in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom.  My parents had cosigned the apartment for me and H's family cosigned for her. The apartment was located near a uni (this is important for me because I didn't want to spend 6 hours commuting every single day from my parent's house). Living with H and N was fine, but living with R and S was a nightmare, I personally have no problem with smoking as long as it's not in my room because the smell of weed gives me insane migraines, but they would smoke CONSTANTLY. They would leave the windows closed, play music super loud, and loot my pantry for food. We were given several warnings for the noise level in our apartment, but R and S paid no attention to this, possibly because R was an exchange student and she didn't give a fuck about being evicted or ruining her credit score. S wasn't on the lease so she didn't give a rat's ass. 

However, on December 2016 N decided that she wanted to move out because she was having a lot of issues with R (backstory: R and S didn't like N and was giving her a really hard time living at the apartment by being extremely passive aggressive). N was able to get off the lease since she was smart enough to sign a separate lease with the property manager from the beginning. H also left in December because she found a job and had graduated. H found someone to sublet her spot in the apartment, B. I had recommended B because she was my best friend. H was not fortunate enough to get her name removed from the lease like N was. 

Towards the end of December, R had suggested to me that we should have our mutual coworker, Z, live with us in the apartment, and she could take over N's space in the living room plus it would ultimately lower the cost of rent (500-ish per person). So Z moved in in the beginning of January 2017. I honestly did not like Z from my very first encounter with her at work. But I ignored it for the sake of cheap rent; I kept my distance from her just in case. R initially roomed with me, but when B moved in, B had asked to share a room with me since we are best friends. Everything was fine in the apartment because I do not interact with the girls much besides for B, I also leave on Fridays to go back home to see my parents for the weekends. B also leaves home for the weekend, so only R, S, and Z remained in the apartment. 

Around mid-April, I told R, S, Z, and B that I will be moving out in June because I will be graduating, so I asked them whether they wanted me to find a subletter, or they can find their own subletter. They decided that I should find my own subletter. So I took it upon myself to post on Facebook in some of our school groups to find people. On the post, I had listed the apartment like how it was advertised to me, ""Two-bed room, two baths, one parking spot available."" We had two parking spots one for B and one for myself, I do not have a car but my boyfriend does, so when he picks me up or spends the night there, he will park in the spot rather than parking on the street and risk a ticket, plus it made it easier for me when I drag my two luggage up to my apartment.  I got a text the next day from R who insisted that I should not include the parking space because the parking space should be reserved for them. I told R that this was unreasonable because no one in the apartment had a car beside for B. R, Z, and S began spamming my phone and insisted that I take off the parking space. To me, this was extremely unreasonable because I had begged the manager to give me that extra parking space for when my parents visit me during the week and for when my boyfriend picked me up.

I came back to the apartment the next day Sunday,  and this is when the shitstorm has brewed. Apparently, while I was gone Z got the idea to instigate shit with R, and S, by telling them that I had wanted S gone, and wanted to kick her out of the apartment since she is not on the lease. I HAVE NEVER SAID SUCH THING. I have mentioned to Z that I was worried about her and S being evicted out of the apartment if the manager knew that there was 5 of us living in the apartment. So while I was unpacking in my room, R barges in like a fucking bull and was being extremely aggressive and violent. She began hitting, and banging the walls, bitching, and insulting me; at this point I am terrified, I had never been treated this way or have had anything like this happened to me, so I should like a stone while my boyfriend asked that they leave my room. S then came out of nowhere and started crying asking if she could talk to me, at this point only half my brain was functioning because I'm still so shocked. The minute I walked out of my room, S, R, and Z began to insult and demanded that I removed the parking; they tried to pin everything on me and insisted that I'm at fault for posting the parking space and that I'm a vile bitch for wanting to kick S out. My boyfriend tried to intervene but these bitches are so persistent and threatened him to leave. At this point, I couldn't take it anymore because if I had sat there longer I would have broke. So I stood up and walked to my room. 

After the incident, I stayed in my room more frequently, I only came out of the room when I needed to eat or heat up food. I stopped cooking and using the kitchen beause it would meant seeing R, S and Z. A week after,  I tried to see an on-campus therapist because my anxiety was spinning out of control, and I couldn't hold down food that I ate. I knew myself and I knew my anxiety, so I seeked for help, but seeing the therapist wasn't much helpful since I was still returning to the toxic environment of the apartment. I finally found someone to take over my spot in the apartment, I'll call her Jo. I was worried that Jo would back out of the apartment, so I came to the lawyers at my uni to asked for help, they basically told me just to write an agreement between Jo and I stating that she is my subletter and that Jo wants to renew the lease once it ends in August 2017. However, this was not what I wanted, I also wanted to get out of the lease since my parents are also on the lease and I do not want to have any ties to the apartment once I move out. I tried asking the property manager if Jo could take over my lease, and they turned me flat down. I'm still stuck on the lease until August 31, 2017. Is there any way I can get myself off? I'm no longer living there. The property manager asked Jo to sign a paper to add herself as a subrenter, but Jo could not take over my lease because apparently there is ""no such thing."" Basically I can get out of the lease in August when I submit a 30 days noticed, but all of the tenants on the lease has to sign me out of the lease. 

A second issue that I have is with R, when I left the apartment in June, I had told her that I will be cancelling the electricity bills since it was under my name.  I came into work today and realize that R had ran to my supervisor saying that I had thrown her under the bus because I turned off the electricity and B moved out of the apartment. The day before, she had texted me and asked me for my social security nuber so she can access the electricity bills even though I have already canceled it, I turned her down but she thought this was a great excuse to bring up to my supervisor. This has made me feel extremely uncomfortable since I had never expected her to bring this personal issues to work, let alone tell my supervisor. She has constantly been bothering and harrassing me, when B left, she thinks that I should give her B's mom's phone number because they want the next month's rent.  Any tips on how I can deal with her?",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75,0.25,,,,,,

Hear me out i understand work can be an unpleasant and chaotic for all parties. But im genuinely infuriated by the horrible and incompetent management at my work. They neglect to intervene when coworkers berate and make crude jokes about each other. They are often attentive to customers, but neglect any of the needs and concerns of coworkers. I was literally in a yelling match with my supervisor before we both got told to go to HR to mitigate things, mostly in the supervisors favor. Is there anyway i can at least threaten legal action via phone call, letter etc. to get them to listen to my concerns more? How would i go about initiating this?

 1. We signed in July of 2016 with the terms intended that it would end on August 1st,2017. Our lease instead states August 1, 2016 as the termination date. It however goes on to state that rent must be paid over 12 months OR for the 12 months rental amount. 
2. There is no written term for when a renewal lease must be signed and no written or otherwise discussed term for how much notice must be provided if we choose not to sign another lease. 
3. There is no written term stating that the lease defaults to monthly following the initial lease. However Maine does state that if payment is given and accepted following the end of a lease it is assumed to be a monthly lease for as long as payment occurs and is accepted.

I have a few questions, so I will be brief. Please feel free to respond to one or all of my questions.   First, I admit that I caught him by going through his emails. He wrote down his email/passwords in his journal, and I found it; I looked through his inbox and discovered many things. I discovered that he is dating a young woman with a child (not his) and he has been sending her money through Paypal (because I also discovered his paypal account). He has been telling this young woman that he is in the middle of a divorce from my mother (he is not), and that my mother is ""stalling"" by ""not signing the papers"".    He sent his girlfriend an email (fwd) from his lawyer, talking about the Judge (who does not exist) looking at the case. However, his lawyer does not really exist either; my father created this lawyer, created his email address, and proceeds to email himself, so that he can fwd the email to his girlfriend, making it look official. I apologize if that sounds confusing.  Additionally, he has told this lady that he served the Iraq/Kuwait conflict (he did not) and he created an email address for a soldier he ""served with"" who does not exist. He then emailed himself, as this character he created, and gave this detailed story, making himself look like a war hero. This story he made up was meant to serve as a character witness to the Judge (who doesn't exist) for his divorce (which is not happening).  My questions: **1)** Since I went through his emails and other accounts to find this information, have I committed a crime? **2)** Has my father committed a crime (fraud?) by telling this woman he is getting a divorce? What about the lawyer, judge, and character witness he made up? **3)** Has my father committed a crime with the ""war hero story"" he made up? He claimed to have ""turned down the medal of honor"" ..is this stolen valor? **4)** His Paypal account has a few bank cards linked to it.

5b60e59dda52255c20d037e6,"[USA] Received notice for Ford class action lawsuit; I don't believe I'm eligible, but is it worth looking in to?. I purchased a certified used 2014 Ford Focus in July 2015 from a Ford dealership. Within a month of ownership, I began to have clutch shudder issues; I eventually got this repaired under warranty by a local Ford dealership. 

I've also had two recall notices within a year of ownership; one was for a faulty sensor, and one was for a defective piece in my door which could cause my door to fly open while the car is in motion. The door recall stated that an additional notice would come out when parts were available for this repair; it took around 8 months for me to get notice I was now eligible for repair. I got the sensor repaired under warranty.

The class action settlement notice says these are the following conditions:

&gt; If your vehicles transmission is malfunctioning, you may be entitled to a repair or a repurchase of your vehicle, through an expedited binding arbitration program created by the Settlement. (I am not currently having transmission issues to my knowledge, but I am getting an oil change by a trusted mechanic this week, and am tempted to have him give my engine/transmission/sensors a once over.)

&gt; If an authorized Ford dealer performed three or more transmission software flashes on your vehicle, you may be entitled to cash payment ranging from $50-$600, depending on the number of visits. 

&gt; If an authorized Ford Dealer replaced three or more qualifying hardware parts on your PowerShift transmission while you owned the vehicle, you may be entitled to cash payments ranging from $200-$2,325 or Vehicle Discount Certificates ranging in value from $400 to $4,650, depending on the number of service visits. (I definitely don't qualify for this; I only had one transmission repair, and one sensor repair).

&gt; If you paid for a repair for the Powershift transmission that you think should have been covered by warranty, you may be entitled to be reimbursed. (My warranty covered my repair)

&gt; If your vehicle was manufactured after June 5, 2014 and two or more clutch replacements were performed on your vehicle under warranty, and you had to pay for a clutch replacement after warranty, you may qualify for reimbursement.  (I only had one official clutch repair under warranty.)

It says that if I do nothing, I will be named as a part of this class action lawsuit, and can claim benefits (but cannot sue Ford at a later date).  I don't think I qualify, so I don't see any point in me remaining in it. However, I don't see any issue with seeing where this goes, seeing how my car performs over the next few months (the suit will be filed in August 2017), and the hearing will take place in October 2017. Given the sheer amount of issues I have had with this vehicle since purchasing it, I don't want to exclude myself in case I suddenly do start having more transmission issues.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03810,"Need Legal Advice - Wife might have signed a contract for a shady summer job (in New Jersey). Thank you for reading this and I understand that this is not exactly the official advice I should run into a courtroom with but I will take any and all advice and suggestions.

Long story short; my wife accepted a post at a summer job for eight weeks and signed a contract for this position.  This post is in New Jersey. The contract is for an 8 week position and she is to be paid $2450 total for all 8 weeks.

First question: As this position requires her to work from at least 8:30 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday, that makes a total of 37.5 official working hours per workweek. She's getting $306.25 per week. That translates to $8.17 an hour and in NJ, minimum wage is $8.44 and hour. Is that legal to hire employees via a contract for under minimum wage? Does it matter if it is a seasonal position?

Second question, going with the 7.5 hours of a work day, she is not given any breaks during the day. She has to set up for the next 'class' and she was told that her break is at 5 PM. Remember, her shift ends at 4 PM. Is that also legal? I thought labor laws required employees to take a break roughly every 5 hours.

Third question; is mandatory orientation and training required to be paid to the new hiree? She was told she had to attend these events which took place on three Saturdays prior to her starting date. Each event was roughly 8 hours. She also has had to work other events prior to the start of job such as a ""meet the parents"" night. She has not seen any compensation for this.

Besides teaching during the 7.5 hours per day, she was told she has to drive a minivan to pick up coworkers and clients and that she would be given $600 as a bonus for the 8 weeks of doing this. That breaks down to $75 per week which is $15 per day. The route is roughly an hour each way and that's not including her time to refuel the vehicle and do the mandatory safety inspection checklist of the vehicle to make sure the vehicle is in proper working conditions.

Furthermore the work van is being rented from a company and my wife's name is not on the contract for the vehicle nor is she listed as an authorized driver for the vehicle. 

What would be the ramifications if she was driving the vehicle and something happened? The company she was hired by claims they have their own insurance for the vehicle but with all the other questionable activity, I no longer trust that situation. 

Also, what would be the ramifications for her leaving this position before the eight weeks are up? She has a full time job throughout the year but summers are off. This job was mainly just for a little extra summer spending money.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03863,"Regarding consumer protection laws and culpability for faulty used goods. Background: 

I'm in VA..... somehow

Some time ago I acquired a sensory deprivation tank of craigslist, originally manufactured by the esteemed Zen Float co. (ZFC)

The original kit includes some ZFC branded electronics; heater pads, an immersed pump unit, a temperature controller and two GFCIs. They're kinda shitty though - from the get go the temperature controller was hooped. 

We rolled our own controller and everything worked fine for a couple month, until one day when I was cleaning the tank, it gave me a little shock! Didn't seem that serious, but it did leave a little burn mark, and being all too familiar with how fragile attractors can be... I was compelled to run off to the ER for a quick EKG.

Grand total *after* insurance: $380ish. lol america

OK, but the thing is - even though the temperature controller was a hideous homebrewed mess, this shouldn't have been possible. The circuit was behind 2 GFCIs at the time - 'ground fault circuit interrupters' which measure the current leaving hot and returning on neutral and cut the circuit if they're not the same. A pretty catastrophic failure, especially considering there's an immersed pump! 

Questions:

So one prospect would be to sue for my medical bills, which seems like a stretch because I got it used and did have a homebrewed temperature controller*. But still the GFCI failed catastrophically and perhaps there are some applicable consumer pool electronics laws on my side. 

* just wiring for an off the shelf model... which hopefully means it's legal

I emailed ZFC and demanded remediation a while ago, and I guess was sufficiently intimidating as they offered to purchase the tank back from me, for as of yet not discussed terms. They also keep trying to get me on the phone. Smells like a settlement to me. I haven't responded yet as I wanted to get the lay of the legal land first. 

But I think more serious is that they're selling it with these GFCIs. I do have an older model, so maybe it's changed but I doubt it. I mean I know n = 1 but that's still too many for a fail-safe. 

So, actual questions:

(location: VA)
  
   - what consumer protections are there against faulty electronics? In general? In the context of pools? 
   - is it possible for ZFC to be culpable even though I bought the tank through a third party? 
   - do you accept the axiom of choice? ;)",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,,0.25

I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.

I'm currently in a really sticky position and need some help on climbing out of this situation.

I currently have a house which has me and my mother's name in the deed and is fully paid off. 2 years ago, the DEA raided my home because of something my father was doing. A few months after the raid, the government released a document which indicted a bunch of people. Under that notice, our home was ""subject to forfeiture"" and they put on lien on the home. 

At the moment, my father is nowhere to be found and considered on the run. I have talked to some lawyers a while ago and they said it may be years (upwards to 10 years) before anything happens to the home. So right now it's sitting there and we can't do anything with it. My brother is currently living there along with my mom. 

Here's the problem now. I currently live paycheck to paycheck and can not afford the property taxes. With the current late fee's, it has gone from ~$7000 to $10000. I currently don't live in the home and live a few cities away. I was under the assumption that my mother was going to pay for the property taxes alongside my brother since they are living in the home, but that's not the case. My brother works as a server and my mother does not do anything. I brought up the matter to my mother today when I found out the property taxes were not being taken care of and she basically told me ""Not my problem"". She doesn't care about her credit or the repercussions of what this could do to me.

I'm now stuck with a piece of property that I cannot do anything with and cannot afford the property taxes. It will go up to $12,000 by the end of this year and then the new taxes for 2017 will be around $7500 on top of that.

Is there any way I can abandon the property or give up my portion or convince her to give up both of our portions to whatever government agency so we can just get it off our hands and be done with the fucking stress that comes from it?

I am a native of Westminster California in Orange County. I have no criminal record and have little to no interest in owning a firearm personally. Where I live there are a lot of unfortunate homeless and/or folks suffering from drug addiction. On more than a few occasions, I have been approached in a hostile manner especially at night when I walk my dog. (I tend to get home late.)

While I do not wish to own a firearm for myself, I am still interested in defending myself the best way I know how to. I have been classically trained in swordsmanship and do not feel confident in my skills with a knife. I am curious about how the law works regarding carrying a properly sheathed, fixed blade in the open when I walk my dog to the store and such and while what research I can find on the matter seems to suggest I can do so legally, they have seemed to be lackluster resources at best.

I feel I should further add:
1. No, it is not a katana. (not sure why I felt I needed to add that but there you go)
2. No, I am not a sword wielding lunatic wishing to go all Purge on people.
3. I have no want, desire or plan to harm anyone, and I truly feel for said unfortunate in my city. However, I do simply feel that just the sight of a blade, even still sheathed, would dissuade would be aggressive advances.

5b60e59dda52255c20d038eb,"Friends and I paid a deposit on a rental home, did not sign contract, price quote keeps raising within the month of paying the deposit (Michigan). This is my first time having to deal with renting, but my roommates have rented several times before. We are all going to grad school (my first year, their last year). We have assistantships that give us a paycheck each month. There is a mobile home park across the street from school, and they have great sized homes for what we need - three bedrooms, two full baths, a washer/dryer, dishwasher, central air, etc. It's a pretty great deal.

When we were originally looking, the price range (depending on size and age of the unit) was $879-$929. We put in an application and got accepted, and **at that point paid the $200 deposit**. We called to inquire about a moving date, got told mid-July or end of for moving in, and was alerted that the prices were being raised by corporate and it was now $959-$979. They told us the unit we have was $979 a month...but it wasn't a new unit.

Okay, kind of crappy, but we all estimated highly for rent just to be on the safe side. My other roommates have been heading talking to them, I was just ""added in"" to the contract. According to my roommates, they have been rude. After inquiring about why we are getting a higher price, they were snippy and explained it was corporate and not them.

Fast forward to yesterday, they told us rent is possibly being raised to $999 a month, which is completely absurd. The manager told us she would ""go to bat"" for us to keep the $979 rate after my roommates absolutely blew up her phone and e-mail. She then complained to my roommates that it was only $6 extra per person so she doesn't understand why it was such a big deal. We are paid pennies in grad school, we can't afford a lot in rent especially since we have to pay other utilities here as well as fees and that's not including food and gas. She then proceeded to say that we should be grateful we are getting a spot with such a good deal and so close to the school with so many utilities covered (we have to pay electricity, gas, and internet.) That's a lie, a few other places cover almost all utilities but they have no availability and if we bring it up they'll just drop the contract and tell us to go there instead.

Something about this seems very wrong, it doesn't sit right. I understand that corporate could be raising prices, but isn't it a thing that the price is locked in after paying the deposit? We are paying the rest right before we move in, **as well as signing the contract (we have not done that yet.)** We also have to determine a moving date, we don't know when that is either. We know complexes and parks near schools extort students, especially right across the street from the school, and that is a reason why the price is so high. But it's too late to find something else, I am also scared that if we keep fighting they will take away our contract and we will be homeless.

Since we have not signed the contract, is there anything we can do? I have this impending feeling they will raise the price and continue doing so until I literally will not have any extra money.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75,0.25,,,,,,
5b60e59dda52255c20d0398b,"[NY] My dog broke my neighbor's dog's leg on my property and the dog died during surgery for reasons unrelated to the injury and they now want us to pay for medical bills and dog cost.. So basically i live on a quarter mile long driveway that i share with my neighbor who we were always friends with and kind to but he is at the very beginning near the road and I am tucked away in the woods at the end of it.  We have beach access and our neighbors have right of way to use our driveway and a path on our property only as a means of traveling to and from the beach. They have come over numerous times without warning to watch the sunset on a section of our property that leads to the beach (rather than the actual beach because they can't make it down the waterfall/stream that leads to it).  We've asked them a few times now to let us know before hand (mainly after an incident where a bunch of strangers and cars unexpectedly showed up for homecoming pictures on our land not the beach) when they are going to come down and we have always been ok with them watching the sunsets on our property leading to the beach as long as they let us know ahead of time. So basically the other day while my mom was at work and my dad was working in our garage they showed up walking down the driveway uninvited and without plans of going to the beach. My dad was outside with our three dogs (Rottweiler, golden retriever, and weimaraner all sweet hearts with no previous signs of aggression even in a house with two toddlers) and my sisters when they decided to walk down with a stranger and there three dogs (a lab, a golden retriever, and an 8 week old Australian shepard puppy they just got a week ago but hasn't met my dogs before).  My neighbors were supposed to be getting married on the section of our property that they always watch the sunset on so they said they were walking down to show the guy they brought with him the work they thought they were going to be doing to our land in preparation for their wedding.  I was not home at the time but i guess while my neighbor was walking ahead with the stranger, his fiancé was standing on our property surrounded by her dogs and now my dogs who ran up to see what was going on. I'm not sure how long the dogs were interacting for but the puppy was new to all three of my full grown dogs and the rottweiler ended up biting her and breaking her leg.  She was taken to the vet and had four puncture wounds as well but they weren't serious.  We were all very surprised to hear of the situation and upset as we are all dog lovers and offered to help in some way but we've never been in this type of situation before and didn't know how payment would work for something like that (we were still going to try to help even if we weren't liable) but my neighbors seemed pretty cool about it and said that wasn't a big concern of there's at the moment. So the dog eventually went in for surgery but never woke up from the anesthesia (we're guessing the dog was given too much for it's young age) and our neighbor told us when it happened and said to not call or text today because his fiancé and step daughter were very angry (at us? the dog? themselves? idk). So the next day my dad was coming home from work and stopped coming down the driveway because my neighbor was out and apologized for the situation he was in and my neighbor went straight to telling my dad that he has a couple thousand dollar pet bill that he's going to send him as well as a receipt for the dog that they spent $2000 on at a pet store.  Now my parents were trying to handle this situation as nicely as possible since we felt terrible and have to continue to share a driveway and think about this relationship longterm but feel like we aren't really fully responsible and don't appreciate how our neighbor is acting like it's completely our/my dog's fault and is going to demand this money from us for the incident without taking any responsibility of his own.  We've tried contacting an attorney just to figure out if it truly is on us but all so far have only been for dog bites on humans. Sorry for the grammar mistakes this is just like the 10th time reciting this so I'm getting kind of tired of it and just wanted some other opinions and feedback on the situation.  After them demanding the money basically my parents don't really want to help them pay the bills at all unless they have to but we believe that my neighbors are mostly in the wrong here and that we definitely shouldn't have to worry about the cost of the dog when the vet is the one that killed it even though my dog caused the need for surgery.  Thank you so much for any feedback this is just causing my family a lot of stress and I'd be happy to elaborate more or clear things up that weren't explained well if questions come up.

TL;DR  Neighbors have always been close friends and are legally allowed to cross a piece of our property to reach a beach that only we have access to but they always stop before getting that far and hangout on our property.  They've unexpectedly dropped down numerous times after us asking for just a heads up beforehand but they thought it would be a good idea to do that the other day with no intentions of going to the beach, a stranger with them, and their three dogs (one of which is a brand new 8 week old puppy that my three big dogs have never met).  Eventually while they were down on my property, uninvited and not there for the reason their supposed to come down, my dog with no history of any aggression bit their puppy breaking his leg.  The dog needed surgery but died due to reasons unrelated to the injury and afterwards my neighbors started acting like it was all completely our fault and that we had to pay the full vet bill as well as the cost of the dog.

Also just an FYI incase it comes up, the beach I'm referring to is public but surrounded by 40 foot cliffs and we have access to the only semi easy way of getting down on our property but my neighbors never go all the way down to the public part they are supposed to (again this wasn't a big deal to us when they would tell us ahead of time)",0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.375,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25

5b60e59dda52255c20d039f8,"Tips were garnished from me as a pizza delivery boy (in store). Hey, guys. 

I live in Newport Beach, CA. 

My situation is complex and I will try to explain it to the best of my ability. I was employed by a family owned pizza place in Newport Beach, CA. The business had three locations. As a delivery boy, I would drive pizzas to the person who placed the order and received the money to pay for the pizza along with a cash tip. I would pocket this. If the pizza was paid for through a credit card, I would obtain a signature from the customer. If the customer chose to give me a tip, it was available for them to tip above the signature on the receipt. I was cashed out in full at the end of the night. 

This is not problematic. 

This is what is problematic. 

I never received any cash tips from inside the restaurant (there was a tip jar) and never received any credit tips that were left on a receipt. I have filed a wage claim form, gone through a preliminary conference, and now I am scheduled for a hearing. My ex-boss is claiming the following: 

ALL THREE LOCATIONS EARNED $220 IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD OR $440 IN A MONTH   

This would mean each store earned around $15 a day just in tips. (keep in mind we are in Newport Beach, CA, there is no way the stores made that little per day).  

I almost know for a certainty that the locations earned way more than this amount. How can I make sure he is telling the truth? How can I refute this? 

He is also claiming this: 

BECAUSE (my name) WAS A DRIVER, (my name) WAS NOT ENTITLED TO IN-STORE TIPS. ONLY SERVERS WERE ENTITLED TO SAID TIPS. 

1. My ex-boss never distributed tips to any other employees, if he did, the amount was always $20 and was allocated every month, not every two weeks. From co-workers, I have heard that they claimed to never have been tipped out and never have received any kind of tips (these are the people working as cashiers) 

2. On a busy night, as a driver, I would take at most 6 or 7 deliveries that averaged 2 hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes of driving time and delivery of pizzas. Keep in mind this was only on an extremely busy night. Usually, more often than not, I would take 3 to 4 deliveries which would average at about 1 hour to about 1 hour and 20 minutes. My shifts were 4-5 hours long. During the times I was not driving, I was serving guests alongside the cashiers. I would take phone orders, place orders in person, interact with guests, take food to tables, clear tables, clean the restaurant, bathrooms, do dishes, etc etc etc (My point is that I served many many people and my ex-boss is claiming that because my position was a ""driver"" that I was not entitled to any form of tips) 

How can I prove that I served food and his logic is flawed and not factual? 

I have most if not all of my pay stubs and I have all my W-2s.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03a2e,"Was pulled over, with weed in my car, and a well-known local ""crook."" What happens next is even crazier.. Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

Last night, I was getting off of work at around 11:30pm.  I received a text from a former HS friend that he was stranded and needed a ride.  I don't hang out with this kid, virtually ever, and I haven't really even spoke to him much as of recent.  In all honesty, since HS really...  But I did run into him over the weekend, which is how we re-touched base and he mentioned to me that he was going through a bit of a rough patch, and to top it all off, didn't have a car because it was in the shop.

He texted me an address, and I figured since I was heading back toward that area it wouldn't help to pick the kid up.  I'm generally a very nice guy, sometimes too nice maybe.

Anyway, not within 45 seconds, as we were pulling away, a cop starts tailing me.  I turned once, and as soon as we approached a stoplight, his sirens go off.

Now initially I was a little confused, I wasn't sure why we were being pulled over.  Immediately my friend to the right of me goes ""aw fuck."" 

Apparently, he had some weed on him (not much, 4-5 grams), and ""forgot about it"" until the cop was right behind us with his sirens on.

So, I tried to stay calm.  I figured maybe this was just a fluke, a coincidence; that I had made a rolling stop or whatever.  Well, before I could even think the officer was asking me to step out of my vehicle.  He also KNEW the kid that I was with BY NAME, immediately, and wasn't surprised when he saw him in my car (which makes me realize that he probably saw me pick him up).

Still, I tried to stay collected.  I felt that I personally didn't have anything to hide, and while I was very nervous, I was calm in the fact that if I explained to the officer my situation, I wouldn't be the one in trouble.

Then he informed me that the area in which I picked him up in was one of the ""heavier areas for narcotics trade in the city.""  Immediately my heart sank and I realized that I may have been in some deeper shit than I had imagine.


Well, he asked to search my car.  Initially I told him I felt it wasn't necessary, to which the cop to the next of him IMMEDIATELY rings in the K9 unit.

I have a vast amount of respect for law enforcement.  I have many close friends who are police officers, and my uncle himself was a cop back in the day.  I didn't want them to have to waste their time and resources for this crap, so I changed my response.  I told the officers that after what I had heard about the area in which I picked my friend up, I became a little hesitant as I did not know what my friend had on him.  (I DID not rat him out, I'm not a fucking rat)

So, they searched my car.  My friend was taken out, they searched him too, and found nothing....  Which is when it hit me.  The guy left it in my car.

It took not 45 seconds for the cops to find the baggy in my center console, which apparently is where he left it.

And what do you know after this?  The mother fucker tries to pinpoint it on me, yelling phrases like ""OWN UP TO IT BRO, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MINE"" blah blah blah, just a bunch of bullshit.

I still, stayed collective and said nothing.  I was always told growing up that ""the less you say to cops, the better.""

Well, a few seconds after that, I see him take my friend over to the sidewalk, where they empty the baggy out and crush it into the sidewalk (virtually destroying all evidence they had, which confused me).

He then, walked over, pointed at me and said ""you, get out of here.  Go home.""

I don't know how, or why the cop decided to bless me like he did, but jesus you know I got out of there as fast as I could.

I had a little aftershock about it throughout the day, but all in all I'm just very grateful that there truly are a lot of non-asshole cops out there.  

I did, however, receive a call from a private number around 8pm this evening.  I didn't answer, as I was working, and they didn't leave a message (however I think my mailbox may have been full as I'm currently applying to different jobs as I intend to finish school in December).

My question is, is there anyway I can still get into any trouble for what happened?  If the private number WAS indeed the police trying to contact me (for whatever reason), what should I do?  

Please help, as I may just be incredibly paranoid.  I just want to make sure that I know I'm in the clear from this so I'm not worrying about it over the course of the next 2 weeks.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03a94,"[California] My employer is bullying my co-workers, and I have a flair for the dramatic.. Hello /r/legaladvice,

I work for a privately owned retail chain you may of heard of in the news recently, and we've come under new store management at our outlet here in San Diego county. While I accepted this manager with an open mind and hope, she's done nothing but demoralize my fellow co-workers. She seems to be incapable of separating numbers on a spreadsheet from human beings, but I digress. To keep this succinct, let me jump into actions she's taken and the California labor codes I believe she's broken.

I'm aware of multiple employees she's disciplined for ""excessive absences"". She gave a write-up to one of our pregnant employees who was absent for 3 consecutive days for scabies (a highly contagious and uncomfortable skin disease caused by an infestation of insects **burrowing** into your skin), despite proper documentation from a doctor. She gave a write-up to an employee for missing work due to a family emergency. She gave a write-up to an employee for absences that were clerical errors (she had switched shifts with another employee and had it manager sanctioned, but they marked her absent *by mistake*). The list goes on, and she's expressed plans to reprimand more. Although I myself have not had anything done unjust to myself, likely because I'm leaving soon, I can no longer stand by and let this happen.

I've done my research, and I believe this violates California Labor Code § [233](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=233) &amp; [234](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=234) (tl;dr: an employer can't discipline an employee for sick time off if they don't exceed what they've been allocated by the company, and none of my aforementioned instances have done that). Since this happened to so many and will likely happen to more, it would be difficult to spread this knowledge to everyone verbally. So my plan is to arm my co-workers *en masse*. I intend to print these labor codes and covertly post them in the break-room with the title: ""Have you been punished for absences lately? This may interest you:"". I'm quite sure it'll be taken down very quickly, but I trust the rumor mill and a few backup copies should cover this.

So my question is; am I understanding these labor laws correctly, and what do you think? I am also open to suggestions of all sorts, as well as opinions on how I'm going about this.

It should also be mentioned, I'm sure they'll suspect me. My co-workers (and managers) have grown accustom to my taste in mischief/shenanigans, and often turn to me first when something of the sort has happened. They are almost always correct in doing so. Although I don't intend to admit to doing this, my employer is an ""at will"" company.",,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.75

I've been the higher earner in our relationship. He was out of work, and then took care of our child when I returned to work. In case of divorce, our child would stay with me. We've discussed that, in case we do divorce, we would want to treat our property (~100k 401k, ~200k investments, no house) basically as non-community property, the way it would have been had we not gotten married.

Hey guys, seriously appreciate any advice here. 

My car was parked in my apartment complex's lot and had a resident sticker in the windshield after I registered it with management 2 years earlier. I had left for about 2 months to take car of my father who had a stroke, I didn't let management know I was leaving, paid bills on time while away. Looks like 30 days after I had left they decided they wanted to give everyone assigned parking spots, and if you didn't move your car for painting within a specific date, they would tow you. Obviously didn't move my car cause I wasn't there so car got towed and sold at an auction. I understand it’s my fault for not letting management know I was leaving but I never received any phone calls, emails, or anything from them that my car would be towed, or that we needed to move our cars for the parking assignments. I did receive a letter in the mail from the tow company though, which I only saw 30 days later when I returned home. 

I haven't had a chance to speak with management yet because I just got back. 

This is over a $10k loss for me if I can’t be reimbursed for my car...

5b60e59dda52255c20d03a89,"[FL] Question about debt on a life estate. My grandfather died about 6 months ago and left all of his assets to his recent wife and made her the executor of his will. The one exception to this was my grandparent's house which he left her in a life estate.

Before his death he and his wife co-signed on a loan for several tens of thousands of dollars against the house. This past week I started getting calls from a debt recovery company asking about his finances. I know from my research that my family and I can't be chased down for his debts as we haven't received anything from and have no control over his estate, so I am not concerned about that.

Ideally we would like to sell the house ourselves and pay off the loan or take over the loan and rent out the house so it is not foreclosed on. I checked with my family and the deed was never updated to indicate the remaindermen he had described in his will so the first thing I am doing now is making sure that happens ASAP.

What are our best steps forward after that? Since she was on the loan can they even come after the house as part of the estate?

I wanted to apologize before hand, as I have never dealt with a situation like this before and I may be mixing terms up. If anything is unclear I'll explain to the best of my ability.

I recently received a letter in the mail regarding my deceased grandfather's estate that I was included in the Will for. It included a check for my portion of the estate.The letter stated the following verbatim:

&gt;We represent ****, executor of the estate of ****, Deceased. At this time, we are in a position to make a partial distribution of the amount bequeathed to you under **** will.

&gt;There are insufficient funds available in the estate to make full distributions. Accordingly, we are distributing funds at the pro rata amount of fifty percent of the amount bequeathed. Enclosed please fund two copies of a Receipt, Release, Indemnification, and Refunding Agreement for your review and signature. If you agree with the Receipt and Release document, please sign one copy in the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in the envelope provided. The second copy is for your records. I have also enclosed an estate check payable to your order representing the amount due you as indicated in the release document.

&gt;One the estate is completed, we will be sending you an additional pro rata distribution of the balance of the estate. If you have any questions concerning the enclosed materials, please feel free to contact me at the telephone number listed above.

The letter then continued to the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement that said the following terms:

&gt;NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned, beneficiary, intending to be legally bound, hereby:
1. Declares that he/she has read this instrument and that the facts set forth above are true and correct to the best of his/her knowledge, information and belief;
2. Requests the Executor to distribute the sum indicated to him/her and the acknowledges receipt of such distribution to him/her effective upon delivery to him/her;
3. Releases ad discharges the Executor and his successors from all further liability, responsibility, and accountability with respect to such distribution to him/her;
4. Agrees to refund all or any part of such distribution to him/her if it shoulder later be found that distribution was due to mistake (either innocent of negligent) is that all or part of it should have been paid to others or that taxes or other charges should have first been paid;
5. Agrees to indemnify the Executor against any and all liability, loss or expense (included, but not limited to, counsel fees) that the Executor may ever incur as a result of the distribution to him/her without first securing an award by the Court having jurisdiction over it;
6. Agrees that any claim under this agreement may be brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, agrees to submit to the jurisdiction thereof, and waives any objection to the jurisdiction thereof;
7. Declares it to be his/her intent that this instrument shall be governed by Pennsylvania law and shall be legally binding on him/her and on his/her executors, administration, heirs, successors, and assigns; and
8. Agrees that any period for the limitation of actions for the collection of any erroneous distribution to him/her shall commence only at such time as the Executor shall have obtained actual knowledge of such erroneous distribution and that in no event shall the period for collection of any erroneous distribution be less than two years after the actual discovery thereof by the Executor. 

My major question here is to ask if anything above suggests that I should wait to deposit the check included with these documents and if I should have the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement signed and sent prior to doing so. Also, for an ELI5 of the terms I'd be agreeing to. I ask this because the executor of the will has done some cheap, questionable things in the past that have given his siblings and I reason to be suspicious that he might do something to exploit these terms.

So two years ago my fiance was attending a university in New Hampshire and she received health insurance through the university. After a year she took a leave of absence and moved to California for a job. She received health insurance through her job in California. The university did not cancel her insurance in New Hampshire, so she submitted a form to the insurance company in December 2016 to waive the insurance in New Hampshire and the waiver was refused. She repeatedly reached out to the insurance for several months to sort out why they would not cancel her insurance and she's now finding out (through the university, which has done nothing to alleviate the problem) that there were claims submitted in January, February, and March of 2017. Being in California she couldn't have used the New Hampshire insurance since it was only accepted at the university's medical network. She has proof that she was clocked in at work in California for the times associated with the claims.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03bbb,"Got pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt in the state of Arizona. Hello,

I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop. 

Reference: 
""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary
enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement
laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected
seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace
officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic
stop for another violation. 

Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children
under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement.
Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by
front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle
is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the
age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age
may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty
for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""

From the Arizona state legislature.

The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.

The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.

I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt. 

I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03c19,"[CA] Custody question with an unknown but biological father. Hi everyone, posting this to get some info about a situation in California.  Thank you in advance for your advice and help!  
  
This is a question about custody over a kid.  I read some links (pasted at the end of my post) in an attempt to answer my question, but I'm hoping to get more info and perspectives here.  
  
Will try and keep things simple in bullet form.  Here is some background:  
  
* Anna and Bob have a daughter Sally (Sally is now 8 years old)  
  
* Anna and Bob were never married, they simply lived together.  Bob is legally not the dad, but is the biological father (Sally has no legal father)   
  
* When Sally was still an infant, Anna left Bob due to emotional abuse (not physical as far as I know) and general unhappiness, and has been raising Sally as a single mom for the last 6+ years (while living with Anna's parents)  
  
* Anna and Bob are on civil, if not amicable, terms.  Bob usually takes Sally out for a day/afternoon once a week.  Sometimes Sally will stay with dad a few days at a time, when mom has to travel  
  
* Anna is single, Bob is now dating and living with a woman Candy who has kids from an prior marriage and when he takes Sally, it is almost always with Candy or to her/their home
  
* Bob has never paid any kind of child support, whether documented or undocumented.  Bob (currently) has no legal rights or access to Sally, everything is worked out between Anna and Bob on a personal level.  Anna wants Sally to have a dad, so she wants to keep Bob in Sally's life, even though she does not care for Bob at all  
  
Now for recent events:  
  
* Bob's girlfriend Candy recently met Anna, and started interacting with (borderline harassing) Anna (over text and call), and long story short, as a result of those conversations, Anna fears that Candy may be a bad influence on Sally, or may even be trying to poison Sally against her.  
  
* Anna asked Bob to see Sally alone, or at least not let Sally see / interact with Candy.  Need to emphasize that Anna is not doing this to spite or make life difficult for Bob (and certainly not to get child support).  It is out of genuine concern.  
  
* Bob agreed to do so verbally and over text, but Anna has since discovered that Bob is still taking Sally to Candy's or going out with Candy together, just as before  
  
Questions:  
  
* Does Anna have a (legal) right to request Bob not have Sally see Candy?  Would this be a tenable and legal request?  
  
* What are some ways this could play out from a legal perspective if a custody battle ensues?  
  
To elaborate more on why Anna does not want Candy interacting with Sally--there is no apparent threat or evidence of physical harm / danger.  It's simply that Candy is a drama-filled, selfish, and manipulative person so Anna would rather not have her daughter influenced by Candy.  To be honest, there is probably little tangible evidence that ""proves"" Candy would be a bad influence (not even sure how that works legally), but that's just how Anna feels as a mom.  Bob is not necessarily a deceitful or bad person, but is extremely simple-minded, and likely being controlled by Candy, so Anna cannot rely on Bob to shield Sally from potentially bad influence, or even to keep his word about when and how he sees Sally.  
  
I read the info in these two links in an attempt to answer my question  
  
* https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-child-custody-and-visitation-2997637  
  
* http://www.livestrong.com/article/140913-what-rights-do-fathers-have-if-they-are-not-birth-record/   
  
Based on that, I think Bob will have to establish paternity, at which point he can enter a custody battle with Anna.  What are some ways a judge may rule in this case, with all of the factors above?  Any chance for supervised visitation only, or unsupervised, but specifically no contact with Candy?  I am aware that Anna may appear as a jealous mom in court with such a request, but that is not the case.  She was initially happy that Sally could have some semblance of a ""family life,"" but has since discovered that Candy would not be a good ""second mom,"" so I'm just trying to get a read on the situation from the experts here.
  
Thank you for reading!  Again, any additional help or advice would be greatly appreciated!  Please let me know if more info is needed.",,,,,,,,,,0.75,,,,0.25,,,,,,
5b60e59dda52255c20d03c05,"Kind of lost in Rental situation in Portland, OR. So this is somewhat long, please bear with me: 

It is my first time renting and after 18 months (last 6 in a month-to-month) I got a 90-day end of tenancy notice saying that the house is for sale. 

Now, I was not sure what I was doing and this followed: 

1) Unaware of the 30-day notice to vacate I had to sent I immediately started looking for new apartments and was accepted on a new one today (07/11) with move-in date on August 1st. 

2) and I called the property management to notify I had found a new place and that I would be able to move on August 1st. The agent said it was OK through over the phone. 

After reading about it better I found I had to send a 30-day notice, which was not compatible with move out date of 08/01. 

3) I give the agent a call and tell him I have to send a 30-day notice but in order for it to be valid for 08/01 my date would have to be 07/01. He says it's OK and even tell me that simply stating via email that I was able to move 08/01 was enough. I disagree and say I'll send you a 30-day noticed like that anyway. 

4) I send him a 30-day today notice to the same email he was talking to me, backdated 07/01 and ask for him to acknowledge it and confirm that he was in agreement with my moving date. He does neither of that and ignores the e-mail. 

In other e-mails he is always really vague and avoid direct answers to my August 1st move-out date. He refuses to specify a prorated rent in the case I move in that date.


Now to the problem: 

That 30-day notice says I recognize that failure to vacate on the date set forth may cause owner/agent to suffer actual damages.

Question: 

1) Does he have to acknowledge the 30-day notice on his e-mail and answer my question in order for the notice to be valid? 

2) What happens if I do it the usual way and send first class mail with another one dated 07/12 with a later move out date? Will he be able to say I already had sent one and did not vacate, therefore causing damages? 

3) What is the best way to fix this mess, invalidate the unanswered, previous 30-day notice and have a valid move out date so that I don't end up paying an extra rent? 

Let me know if some part of it is too convoluted so I can explain it better.

I was supposed to move in two weeks ago yet due to a bathroom renovation and a cockroach infestation, I have been unable to move in.

The landlord has refunded me one weeks worth of rent and has told me that I should move in. I will not be moving in as there are  a ton of cockroaches still present. Is there any possible way I could break my lease, despite my landlord's lazy attempt to get rid of the cockroaches? Any and all advice is appreciated!! This is my first lease so I'm still learning.

I provided a little extra background to my situation:
I am in California if that matters at all.

My landlord has made it clear to me that she does not care about me and that she just wants me to move in so I can start paying rent. She has lied to me and always comes up with new excuses about other issues in the studio. 

The reason I want to break my lease is that there is an apartment that is cheaper, ready to move in, bug free, and has a more reputable landlord. Not only would I be able to move in asap I would be saving money as well.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.75,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,,0.25

5b60e59dda52255c20d03cdf,"[GA] Disability fight after 5yrs, suddenly backpay pulled out from under my mom and dad after being approved a month ago. It's all they had to look forward to after a house fire a year ago.. My boyfriends parents, but my mom and dad enough in heart.

Dad (50) has been fighting for disability for over 7yrs, but the first 2 were spent in VA and somehow there is suddenly no record of the doctors appointment had back then. Bad genes and work injury and mental health issues. He's been unable to work. They have been in more than poverty since moving from VA to GA. Mom (51) has been working as best she can with existing fibromialga, diabetes, and having had 2 heart attacks to this point in life. She shouldn't be working, but someone has had to. Little more than a year ago, she got hurt on the job, and while in the midst of a high pay out court case, their house burnt down. Lightning in a midnight April storm. Everything gone but the car that was in a mostly disconnected garage. She wasn't home, but dad &amp; the pets were. They all survived, but the thing was that they could barely put food on the table and gas in the car with other bills to pay on what few hours mom could work in her pained state, so of course they had no home insurance. Mom had to accept a tiny payout and just give up on her case for lack of funds, mental ability, and physical ability to deal with everything.

They were homeless, living in and out of their garage til winter, couch sleeping with not so great family, until a few months ago. Finally got the acres sold that the house had been on. That was April. They got into a rental recently after going about trying to find a place to buy/rent. They ended up having to get a car, they paid off debts, she got a credit card to work on credit to get a loan for a house. They didn't get any substantial amount from the property. They are mostly out of money now, they were sure this disability situation would be sorted out by now, but it's not. It's the absolute opposite. They are facing homelessness again, losing their vehicle, losing their pets, and their minds at this point.

I've not seen the letter about the denial of back pay. I live 3hours away, but will see it in a week. I'm not in the position to help outside of moral support and helping her keep her head on track. She's called government entities, she's got a couple letters to right, I was told she could write a 'Letter of Need' and take it to the social security office... They are in their 50s. I was homeless at 18 and pregnant, to boot. I remember how that was... I can't begin to imagine how this is all impacting them beyond the face they try to keep up for the sake of looking strong.

Now... I have to apologize for going on and one. Here is where I ask for options? Suggestions? They are in Union County. For what that's worth. I couldn't even find a way to fight a divorce I just went through, I've been unable to find them any kind of legal support being so far away.

Hi guys, this is my first time on Reddit but I figure if there's one place that I can get some answers without hiring a lawyer, it'd be here. So to start out I am a small time YouTuber looking to use viral videos in my channel in the context of ""Videos of the Week"". I contacted the publisher of this video 'Jukin Media' in hopes in receiving permission to use a specific viral video. However they told me it would be $1000 just to be able to publish in my video. So the most logical thing is I obviously cannot use it unless I am willing to pay them. However, I have seen this video all over the place, and I know for a fact that these channels did not get permission from Jukin. Also, YouTube has contentid which puts your video through a system that allows publishers to put claims on your work for using certain works in your videos. It also does not allow you to monetize. I would be fine with not being able to monetize and all of that, I just want to use the video. However I do not want to get a copyright strike when I post it or in the future. Am I legally allowed to post this video and just let the ContentId catch it, which would allow Jukin to monetize on my behalf, or am I violating copyright rules?

5b60e59dda52255c20d03cca,"[OK] What type of law firm covers this?. I am in the process of gathering information to find an attorney to bring this up with, and I can't figure out what type of firm this fall under.

I am located in Oklahoma, the company I have an issue with is located in Pittsburg, PA, and has servers located in Costa Rica.  The developer in question I believe is also located in the new england area.

The issue involves an online game that has a MLM type incentive structure, you get returns based on the people under you. It also has a vibrant economy that has real world implications as to results of some games/minigames which are promised to be ""fair"" and ""random"". 

Issue 1: The lead developer changed the incentive structure and cut the earnings from downstream in half.  He justified this as saying it prevents people trying to steal downstreams by profit sharing, as now he ""automatically"" gives the profit sharing back to the downstream. Even though some people did not profit share and so realized a very real 50% or more cut in income.

Issue 2: Over the past few years the developer has made many statements of things he would ""never do/wont happen"" that were then used to make economic choices, but then he does them a few months/a year later to the economic detriment of those who took actions based on his statements. Given that the lead developer and employees have not changed in this time period, it's felt he's still liable for the contradiction.

Issue 3: The lead developer has made several statements about the fairness/programming of some of the minigames in this game, that are either provably false, or probabilisticaly unlikely to be true, that has similar economic damage. While randomness is hard to prove/disprove, deviations can be shown on results in-game vs an out of game programmed simulation with the same ""rules"".

So my questions are:
 
1. What type of firm should i be looking for?  Civil litigation? Fraud?  

2. What jurisdiction am I looking at/will i need to get a national/out of state firm or is it not an entire waste of time to check in-state consultations first?

I support my wife and myself and she wouldn't be able to make ends meet without me around. What should I do? How effective would a lawyer be in my situation? This is my only legal trouble as an adult, I got in trouble when I was 16 but had it dismissed. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03dfb,"(KY) kids dad had me served with civil summons asking for joint custody and to be the primary. Says I cannot provide a safe and stable environment. I can and have always been the primary and want to fight this. What do I do?. Okay, so, basically my kids dad had me served with a civil summons yesterday petitioning for joint custody with him being the primary.
For some backstory, we were together for 8 years, have two daughters, 5 and 7, and have been separated for four years. Never married. No prior legal agreement in place. Since we separated I have always been the primary parent. He never had them more than a couple days a week, has never paid child support, never there when I needed him, everything has always fallen on me.
We have been having issues for quite awhile now. He has always been very unreliable. Doesn't pick them up when he says he will, doesn't answer calls or texts, never says when he'll drop them off, will be set off by the most random things and threaten to keep them and not give them back. From July to October of last year all of this kept escalating. My oldest picked up lice from school and gave it to me and her sister and he berated me for being ""filthy,"" refused to give my kids back but eventually relented and gave them to my mom after insisting they had lice again after I had already treated them. They didn't. He was erratic with the days he wanted to keep them, was late getting our oldest to school and couldn't pick her up so I had to drop what I was doing to rush to get her. Eventually I stopped asking him to help me out and my mom and I worked out a more reliable  schedule because I just couldn't depend on him or trust him to help me and be a partner. This was fine for about a month until he started demanding I change my schedule so he could see them. He wouldn't work with me and I got scared so I cut off contact while I saved money for a lawyer. 
We have been back in contact for about a month now. He showed up at my moms house, said he was going to call cps on me, the cops, that I am unstable, etc. I talked to him and he told me all he wanted was visitation. I sent him a very long text outlining my issues and concerns but telling him I was more than willing to work with him and go to a mediator but I wasn't comfortable with him taking them until there was something in place. He never responded and instead had me served with this summons.
I'm calling lawyers as soon as possible to formulate a response to the summons since I only have 20 days but I guess what I am asking is what are the chances I would lose primary? I have had some missteps in my past which play into why I did not seek out a legal agreement sooner, I was a stripper which I thought would hurt me and I did mess with substances. (Nothing major like heroin or anything and I was never addicted or did anything around the girls). Now though I am steadily employed since November and have moved up quickly at my job. I have been clean from any and all drugs for almost a year. I don't smoke and I rarely drink. I have a reliable paycheck and benefits. The girls go to school in my district, I have a stable home, I've had the same boyfriend for four years and we don't even live together, I provide everything for them emotionally and financially. He has never provided support or had them more than a couple days a week in all the time we have been separated. 
I believe he's trying to file this way to get out of child support and to hurt me. He is a very manipulative, vindictive person and I know he doesn't like me standing up to him so he is going to do everything he can to drag me down. I'm afraid me cutting off contact will play against me. In his summons it sounds like he is going to go after my environment and emotional stability. What do I need to do to prove what he is asking is not in the girls best interests? What are the chances he will get what he is asking? Is there anything that will hurt me going forward and that I need to do to prepare? I am fine with working with him on the joint custody part but I absolutely do not want to lose primary. I'm scared and need some reassurance. Thank you guys.",,0.25,,,,,,,0.25,0.75,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,0.25

When we obtained the key, we immediately realized that the entire apartment smelled of smoke, the hardwood floors were covered with dirt, the carpet was filthy, the dishwasher was falling out of the carpentry, there was rat feces behind the fridge and on the back of the fridge, the bathroom sink was broken, there was mold on the ceiling of the living room and bathroom, and the piping for the tub needed to be replaced (this was not found out until the next day).

I am getting paid hourly wages, every other week by form of a personal check. I have not signed any paperwork or anything like that, nor does she intend to have me sign anything.

Everyone is very friendly and have known each other for a while.

So they had declined and so the Partners had sent a resignation to us. 

We had accepted the resignation, as my parents didn't know any better(This was a lifelong dream for them, so if they got that over with, they would have had full control over the school). And so immediately they had sent us multiple messages about amending the lease, which we would have done, except for the fact that they are keeping everything with them, and was refusing to give them to us (which are things like the Master Business license, and other things but I don't want to identify myself to them). The man in the other couple was representing us as our realtor, and he never gave us our lease agreement. We got it after contacting our landlord's agent for that.

Currently separated, going through a very ugly divorce battle with my (hopefully soon to be ex) wife...neither of us can afford attorneys because of financial troubles (excessive debt) accumulated by her when we were together.  Not to mention, she cheated on me for a year before I found out.  During that time, she got herself in to legal trouble (related to the cheating) which caused additional financial hardship.  

However, she has managed to get an attorney through a women's legal center somehow by lying about me and how I have treated her.  When, in truth, I endured about 10 years of mental/emotional abuse from her before I decided the marriage could not be saved. 

Now that she has an attorney, and I don't, she is trying to ""stick it to me"" with a vengeance.  She has kept the children from me on occasion (to be vindictive) when it was my rightful visitation time, and she also says negative things about me to our daughters.

Are any of you aware of lost cost / pro bono options for a father that has been taken advantage of but is still trying to do the best he can for his children?   It doesn't seem fair that she can lie and get an attorney for free, and I, the law abiding father that has never missed a child support payment and see my kids as much as possible, can't?

5b60e59dda52255c20d03ed7,"Messed up developer-controlled condo, Massachusetts.. So I bought a condo, Massachusetts, back in 2012 (worst decision I’ve made to date).  Only 2 units were built, one building townhouse style.  The second unit sold shortly after.  The developer still has not built anymore units (leaving it about 95% unfinished) and gets in trouble with the city every time he tries (ignoring wetland issues and cease and desist orders).  He periodically lists the development for sale but no one has bought it.  I, with the other unit owner, take care of plowing and general maintenance.  The developer no longer collects dues from us and just leaves us be.  I haven’t heard from him in about a year now.

Not sure what lead me to check out title of the property but it looks like a mess. There are all these quitclaim deeds to Nevada corporations this guy has set up, sometimes for $1 and sometimes for more.  Back and forth and now a deed clarification of some other corporation saying that they have the valid title.  This new corporation, while previously created by our developer, doesn’t look like it is owned by him anymore.  From what I can tell, the property has been passed around for shares in these corporations.  I spent half a day in google digging up all sorts of stuff I didn’t want to know and didn't really understand.

So not even sure if our developer is even our developer anymore.

What kind of mess is this and how do I protect myself?  I eventually want to be able to sell, but my gut says that won’t be possible.

In 2013, a friend was arrested for marijuana possession in New Jersey. This particular Police Department likes to post all drug related arrests on their FaceBook page. Well, here we are 4 years later, the charges were “Conditionally Discharged”, and this post is still up, and out there trackable with a quick Google search.
My question, is there any way to have them remove this post? My friend is trying to get out of retail, and apply for a desk job, where they will likely Google their name. We have not yet contacted the department to have it down; I wanted to check here for the best ‘strategy’. Isn’t it time to move on from the past? Do the crime, pay the time, and move on.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03f1e,"For anyone planning on fighting a restraining order. Minnesota: Feel free to delete this if it's not allowed. Obviously this isn't a question, but I think it's information that could be helpful.

After years of butting heads back and forth with someone, we got to a point where a restraining order was put into place. We have emails back and forth for almost a decade fighting- never any physical threats, just verbal assaults. Eventually, I filed a police report against this person. In retaliation, this person filed a restraining order against me.

I got a lawyer and we had our day in court. For anyone who is in this position I want to give the most broad synopsis of what happened, and what I firmly believe will likely happen with your case. The judge doesn't listen to any reason as to why you have contacted the person who requested the order. None of that matters when you are in a position where someone is claiming any level of harassment. In my case, if I had filed first the judge would have granted the order for me against the other person. The fact that you have responded to someone else's initial actions doesn't matter, only what the judge sees as harassment against the original filer. It's safe to say the judge probably realizes there are actions on both sides and doesn't need to waste time listening to it all if they can see any sort of harassment one way.

To make it even more simple, it's like this: Person A punches person B. Person B punches person A. Person A files a restraining order. The likelihood of that order being granted is high. Both people don't get along and one restraining order will keep these people from contacting each other and in the eye of the law it doesn't matter who files because a restraint order is universal. The court doesn't care what it looks like as far as who filed against who. Only the fact that there is any proof of animosity that is patterned and has potential to escalate.

The fact that you were antagonized or provoked into hitting Person A doesn't matter in a court of law- the judge won't hear it. It *only* comes down to who is filing the restraining order and what the defendant did. 

I hope this saves someone a thousand dollars in legal fees- I wish someone had told me this, it would have saved me quite a lot of grief in the last few months. If you have a different opinion I would love to hear it, because it certainly seemed like my case would be universal to how all of these issues are handled by a judge.",,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25

Hello all. Made an alt account to ask for help.

1 weekend ago I went to a rather large cosplay convention in another city and went about my day. I went with a group of 3 and we were a Zelda BoTW group cosplay. Anyway, it has been brought to our attention that some photographer at the convention had taken pictures of random passerbys (couples, single adults, even kids!) in cosplay, and he posted our picture online to sell. One of the photos was of my group. I am the only person in our group under the age of 18, and I do not feel comfortable with my face in cosplay being on a website where someone can buy the picture. He never asked us for a waver to sign, he just took them without our consent.

We contacted the people who run the convention and they contacted the photographer, and he said its legal because the convention center is a public venue and he will not take them down. I don't think he even bothered to ask the staff if anyone under the age of 18 complained.

5b60e59dda52255c20d03ff1,"[MI, USA] Property Legal Advice-Public Beach Access. First, some background. I live in a small community on the Western Shore of Lake Michigan. Holland, Michigan to be exact. For a town that claims to be a ""beach town"" there is a significant lack of access points to the beaches because of private property. About 5 minutes from my home is a private development of beach cottages. The development has a gate and a gatehouse that is staffed by college kids during the summer to keep us locals out. After Labor Day it is unstaffed again and we can walk right in and use the beach (though we are still technically trespassing I assume). I surf on Lake Michigan (yes it's possible) and this beach is one of the better surf spots on the coast and I want access to it whenever a swell hits. 

So I started doing some research and found Ottawa County's GIS system that outlines property lines and public right of ways. Here are a couple pictures from the [GIS Maps](http://imgur.com/a/TcOwi)

A couple questions I have: 

1) The streets are marked as right of ways (blue in color), does this mean they are PUBLIC right of ways even though they continue after the gate house? 

2) Is that uncharted area of beach in the second picture actually public beach? If I can get there can I stay and not be kicked out? 

3) Is there any law that states I can pass from the right of way across their strand of beach to make it to the public beach? 

I know this is a ""first world problem"" but these people are jerks. This property is owned by the Van Andel family (co-founders of the company Amway) and they built a huge house here and started blocking access to the beach after that. A couple years ago some residents protested but they got nothing more than a snarky response from the property manager. I'd love to see a small victory for the little guys like me.

The specific house didn't show, so I emailed the agency and was told to apply for this other house and they'd transfer the application, as the house I wanted was new enough that they hadn't posted it to their website yet. 


A week or so went by after I submitted the application (with a trove of personal info-- SSN, income information, past addresses...) and then I contacted them again. I was told that, in fact, the place was not actually on the market and that they had messed up.


At this point, I was a little upset and suspicious, but I reasoned that maybe it was really just a rental agency that had no idea what they were doing. 


Just today, however, I found the same place listed on trulia, contacted under a different name, and was able to set up another tour. This has removed most of the doubt that these people are honest; I highly doubt the place has been put on, taken off, and then put on the market again in the span of a month.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So this is likely a scam, but my main question is: is this most probably a scam to promote other listings by the agency (in other words, a shifty advertising/sales strategy) or do I need to take some major identity theft precautions?

The real estate agency in question is True Real Estate Management, which seemed legit enough to me upon some research, but I may be missing something

5b60e59dda52255c20d04035,"[MI] Effectiveness of reducing/dismissing my traffic ticket?. Hello

I am a college student, and this is my first ticket.

I hit somebody's back corner and then I fell into a ditch, totaling my vehicle.  The other driver only had corner damage on his car.  Nobody was injured.

I received a traffic ticket for failing to stop for assured distance.  I had the cops come to the scene to simply prove that the other driver was not at fault.  I was surprised that I received a ticket.  Later, I learned that calling the cops is not necessary, as long as information is exchanged.  The other driver was not jumping to call the police right away.  I regret involving the police.  I feel that I screwed myself over, beyond what was necessary.  I feel that totaling my car and denting the other guy's car does not call for a citation, especially considering the other guy did not offer to call the police.

I have a pre-trial soon.  I have to talk to a prosecutor and make a deal.  I would ideally like to drop the whole case, as my father's insurance is taking care of vehicle damage.

I am educating myself about courts.  I learned that the prosecutors want to spend more time prosecuting midemeanors/felonies and other serious issues.  They just want to get petty tickets out of the way.

Would it benefit me to ask for my case to be dismissed, and if he doesn't budge, say ""I want to learn more about the court process, so I am going to have trials regarding my ticket, so I can explore all of my options.  I have time because I am out of school for the summer.""

Would this make the prosecutor want to back off and not want to deal with me, especially because I am young.  I have had my liscense for about a year.  I know it costs a lot of money to run the courts.  I recognize that it's assumed that people who hit cars from behind are at fault, but the reality is, traffic court is designed to suck money from people.  The other driver wasn't upset when I talked to him.  I just want the insurance to fix the other guy's car, and move on with my life.",,0.25,,,,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.75,,0.25

5b60e59dda52255c20d04050,"Sprint lost a leased phone I returned. Have receipt from corporate store. They are trying to charge me for the phone.. Basically as title says. Got my son a contract with sprint, hes 16 so I pay for everything, got him a brand new LG V20 with a lease style contract under the condition that he worked for his uncle on the weekends. 

Well 16 year olds will be 16 year olds and he skipped out on more than 7 days worth of work. So punishment was I returned the phone to sprint and got him a basic flip phone with no data. 

I returned the phone to a corporate sprint store and paid a 35 restocking fee. I have a digital receipt from the store that shows the model and serial number of the phone returned. 

Somehow sprint lost the phone between the time I was given a receipt and now. 

They sent me a bill for 423.72. 

100 of that is my monthly payment and the other part is the cost of the phone I returned. 

I called last month when this happened and filed a dispute. Heard nothing back from them. 

This month I receive a pay or disconnect notice for the outstanding balance of 320 for the price of the phone. So I called very mad  but kept my cool. Talked with a supervisor and she seemed very helpful until the end. She said she would start another claim and it would be a week for the resolution. 

I asked her what happened with the first dispute and she said there was no resolution. I asked her what that means and she said she was unsure. She said she would place a hold on my account for the 320 to make sure it does not disconnect my service, but that hold would expire at the end of the claim. 

Well that happened today. I called again and made sure to speak to the same lady. I even waited on hold for 45 minutes to make this happen. She tells me that the claim was denied. No reason for the claim being denied was given.

I asked her if she had the receipt. She said no. I sent her my digital copy of the receipt. She agreed that his was an official receipt and was able to verify it in the system. But that I still owe for the phone. 

She has a receipt that she agrees is legit showing I returned the phone. So I did my part here. How can she claim I owe her money for a phone I followed procedure with? IS there any legal ground for her to say I owe for an expensive phone they lost?

5b60e59dda52255c20d040bf,"Cosigned a car loan with now ex girlfriend. This is actually more for my boyfriend than myself, as it's his ordeal but he doesn't have reddit so I figured I could attempt to see how other people have handled similar situations. 

My current SO and his ex girlfriend (we'll call her Jill) cosigned on a car together over a year ago. It was supposed to be just hers but she couldn't get approved for the loan she needed so he apparently thought that it would be fine and agreed to help her out. Fast forward a year and some change, they decided to go their separate ways. Jill moved back to her hometown in New York, we live in Indiana. When she left, she took her car (he didn't want it) on the verbal agreement that she was going to trade it in and eat the fact that it's worth less than they owe on it.

Fast forward through her missing two payments and a lot of calls to the credit union, this has become an absolute nightmare. It's current on payments now due to SO making the payment on the car he doesn't have. Jill is upset because she doesn't want him to come get the car even though she doesn't want to make the payments. Essentially she feels like he owes her something and now that the other two payments are deferred and off his credit, she knows he'd rather suck it up and make the payment then let it hit his credit again. 

She won't respond to texts, calls, emails, etc unless it's the rare occasion that she ""feels like it"" which is usually when she needs something from him or feels like harassing him on that particular day. 

Notes:
-They owe 19,000, the car is worth 14-15,000
-He doesn't care for the car, doesn't really want it. 
-also doesn't want to continue making payments on a car for his ex girlfriend who has now put ~30,000 miles on this car with no oil change and doesn't take care of things to begin with
-Jill does not want to hand over her keys, or cooperate in any form 

The tags on the car expire in two weeks, so those need to be paid. It's up to date on payments now, but in three weeks this will be another go around. 

Clearly there have been several mistakes made here, trust me I am personally appalled by how the entire thing came to be, but that's beside the point. 

Is there anything legally he can do to get the car in his possession, or out of his possession? He just doesn't want to continue to make a payment on a car he doesn't have, and also continue to worry about wether or not she is going to make the payment every month. 

TLDR: Current SO cosigned on a car with his ex. She is in physical possession of the car and won't make the payment (assumingely out of spite) and knows that he will because he doesn't want the ding on his credit. He doesn't care who ends up with the car, just doesn't want to keep paying on a car he doesn't have or worry about her not making the payment.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,,,0.25

Because my job is high physical activity I am in the process of claiming disability and my employer has been extremely helpful. Since I also live in a walk-up in an urban area I can't access my apartment safely without supervision so I decided to stay with my mom in a different state until I can have the surgery. 

The problem is I didn't have insurance at the time of the disability so I've been having to pay out of pocket for MRI/X ray and Doctors visits to make sure I would really need surgery, out of the state I live in. My insurance kicks in next month so I'll have to wait until then to get the surgery, unless I want to pay over 10k out of pocket. I can't yet make an appointment for the surgery because I'm not insured yet, even though I will be at the time of the appointment. I get it, it's a legal issue. There are a lot of 'should haves' in this scenario and I am to blame for why this is spiraling. I'm gaining back control of the situation but it's going to be a longer process now. However, this is not where my issue is.

I went to urgent care and paid out of pocket so I could get referred for an MRI and specialist. Okay. Did that. When I saw the specialist I asked specifically if I would be able to work and how long would it be. He said absolutely not and that it would take up to 8 months to recover, post-op, back to my high activity level. My employer then suggested I file for disability. When I spoke to the office again they said they wouldn't fill out my claim because I'm not getting the surgery with them and that it could be a legal issue, however when I pressed them on why they didn't really give me a lot of information. When I spoke with my employer's insurance company they said they just needed the word on whether I could work or not, and that the surgery dates could be figured out later. 

Then, I tried going to the urgent care to see if that first Doctor could fill out my disability form (since he was the one who referred me and scheduled the MRI etc). His receptionist said that it would take up to 2-3 visits, possibly more to get the claim filled out ($150 per visit!). It's literally one sheet of paper asking if I can work. That's it. The MRI is proof enough I can't and I have my medical forms from the hospital. When I asked why she wouldn't give me an explanation, all she said was it would take time to fill out the paperwork (but doesn't know exactly how much time) and that we could see a specialist if I needed it that badly. I am at a loss. I'm in the process of finding my own specialist and surgeon in my state and that's become a wholly different issue otherwise I could've had that provider help (and will if none of this gets figured out but time is a factor with paperwork) ...

Can the hospital refuse to sign the disability papers because I'm not having the surgery with them even though they told me I will absolutely need surgery and won't be able to work?

Can the urgent care doctor ask for an unknown amount of medical visits just to fill out one piece of paper? I feel like I'm being price gouged.

I know this is my fault, yes I should've had insurance and yes I should've seen a doctor in my state immediately to start the process of finding a specialist. I really did not think my injury was  going to need surgery at the time and thought I could just heal my way out of it. I'm learning a hard lesson this month and paying out of pocket for it. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you",,0.75,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,

5b60e59dda52255c20d04195,"[ME] I've been running a Ghost Analysis team and now I'm worried about the drawbacks. Good morning all,

I've never been a big believer in ghosts. I believe in the afterlife, but not ghosts.

About a year ago I saw a post on Craigslist looking for a ""Supernatural tester"" to come to a womans house and test if it was haunted. She said she required some evidence of legitimacy to be hired. So I printed out a license that stated I was licensed to ""Ghoul Inspect"" by the United Paranormal Hunting Association(UPHA). Technically, this is true. But I had started UPHA about an hour after I saw the CL posting. So I licensed myself. 

Anyway, I went to the (obviously not) ""haunted house"" and looked around. I said that there were no ghosts and only took half of what she offered(She offered $300 so I took $150). I figured this was a win/win/win in a kind of scumbag way but at the same time the girl said the other people who emailed wanted $900 and she *was going to pay it*. Plus she would have been told they were real.

Anyway, so I realized how amazing this is for money, so I did it to other people, all while making the operation look more and more legitimate. 

At my best after bringing in two friends to help, I made $1700 from 12 people in a single week for about 10 hours worth of work. 

Anyway so this is one of the two cases that worries me. 

The first is this:

So about 3 months ago I met this Super Atheist and she lived with an older lady(Her aunt). Her aunt was quite wealthy(they own a local business in a ritzy part of Maine, you'd know it if you lived there) and she had inherited it. The aunt basically bankrolls this young girl. The Aunt was convinced she was being haunted by a ghost, but she didn't know who(though she had a few ideas which I won't divulge because of privacy). So the younger girl(Sara) wouldn't agree to call the more expensive ""paranormal investigators"" but called me because I charge $150 for initial investigations, and that was worth it to put the issue to rest. 

So I went there, and here is the thing, I said the house *was* haunted. I needed the return business. I'm not proud, but I did some bad things. I moved items when they were in the bathroom, at one point I took a recorder and stuck it in her ACHV unit to make screaming/moaning noises. All in all, I'm a terrible person and I admit that. 

Anyway, the woman passed and I went over to the house of Sara and said how sorry I am.

But Sara was now convinced that the house was haunted. I know how bad this is because this girl is an atheist with a near ivy-league degree in a STEM Field. My practice *really* fucked her up. 

Not knowing what to do, I doubled down. 

I did just about the worst thing I'd ever done and I took the spare key to the house she gave me and I paid a man to wait in the basement when she came home and then act as scary as possible(he also stole a painting, but I didn't tell him to do that). I thought he would just like pound the walls and then I could say we caught him and the ghost is gone, your aunt is at peace etc etc etc.

Instead this fucking idiot straight up ran after making some screaming noises in the basement and the *GIRL WAS HOME*. I mean he ran out of the basement, and she was him! She got scared out of her mind and then called me.

So I ditched it. I ended the whole practice, changed my number, etc. The ""address"" was just a PO box so I stopped paying for it.

That concerns me but it's on the backburner.

The second one is what worries me.

So after a few weeks had passed I got the service going on the DL and some girl said she needed help. Yadda yadda yadda, I did the standard procedure while mentioning that her daughter might be experiencing some hauntings.

This stupid bitch went out and paid for a $4,900 unofficial exorcism by an unlicensed priest!

So I don't know what to do. What if she comes after me? I never said to do that! Am I in the legal right here? Do I double down and endorse the exorcism?",,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25
5b60e59dda52255c20d041f5,"Washington State VA Abuse Question. Good Morning,

I'm writing this as a request to find out what I should do with regards to patient abuse. The patient in question is my father, and below I've copied the draft that my mother, a RN nurse of 20+ years, wrote.

Essentially my father's back was messing up and we had to go to the ER at the VA due to urinary incontinence and met Dr. A.

Dr. A was condescending, told them they should not be there because the ER is for people with real problems, (cancer, amputations, etc), and asked if my father had any bowel problems. Dr.A was told no, and then insisted on doing 2 anal exams. He never washed his hands, did not physically help my father orient himself, barked orders at him while my father was struggling to move, and threatened to send him home because sphincter tone was normal. 

My mother questioned Dr.A about the urinary incontinence because our primary care physician told us to come in specifically when that occurs. Dr.A ordered a bladder scan, saw the urinary incontinence times 2, then transferred us to the Harborview ER (Seattle). 

Below is the draft letter that my mother wrote to file a complaint, and i was hoping I could get some feedback/help with ensuring that it is received with the amount of urgency that it deserves.

Looking for criticisims/edits/review, as well as legal advice for proceeding forward. 

We are located in Seattle, Wa.


***Draft Letter***

	July 12’ 2017
Attn:  Medical Center Director
	I am sending this complaint in regards to an ER visit for my husband, Patient, on June 18’ 2017. 
	My husband was being treated at the American Lake VA since late May’ 2017 for a back injury.  He’d been to PT with a referral in for Neurology and Sports Medicine d/t quickly progressive symptoms.   During the course of 1 week he went from walking independently to being given a cane and then a rolling walker by PT.  We were instructed at the last MD appointment to go to ER if any difficulty with urination occurred or if pain became intolerable.  
	On Sunday, June 18’2017, we ended up in the Seattle VA ER d/t 2 episodes of incontinence/retention over the past 3 days and intolerable pain.  I arrived with my husband assisting him to ambulate with the rolling walker d/t him being barely able to stand.  
	Dr. A was our ER doctor.  His attitude from the moment he stepped into our room was condescending and dismissive.  He showed nothing but disregard for my husband’s condition stating that people usually come into the ER for real problems such as Cancer or Amputations.  My husband had severe progressive numbness, tingling and pain down his right leg, all of which occurred over the course of 1 week.  He asked my husband if he had any bowel incontinence and was told no.  He then decided to perform a sphincter exam x2 with obvious force with both penetrating entries and no handwashing at any time.  Afterwards he did not wipe the gel off either time but left him there on his side struggling to move in severe pain.   Of note, this is for a man who can’t lie straight d/t back pain and can barely move without assistance.  This was all after bowel incontinence had already been denied.  Dr. A was ready to send my husband home until I questioned him about the episodes of urinary incontinence.  He then decided a bladder US would be in order, which should have been done as opposed to a rectal exam for the initial complaint.    After the US showed urinary retention after multiple attempts he transferred us to the Harborview ER.  On the transfer form he noted my husband to be ambulatory as if he was independent, no note of 1 person assist or ambulatory aide needed.    The end result being my husband was admitted and MRI showed a moderate L5-S1 disc herniation with nerve impingement.  He’s since had a microdiscectomy performed and is now healing.  
	I understand many people have back pain, but for Dr. A to be so dismissive of a person is poor practice and abuse of his own perceived power.  He is a bully to the point he is on the line of patient abuse.    I don’t believe this man is fit to work with patients, especially a vulnerable population such as veterans.  My biggest concern are for the patients in the VA system who have no one to speak for them.  Most veterans are not knowledgeable of how patients should be treated.  The treatment and testing from Dr. A for my husband was wrong and abusive.

The paperwork specifically says not to include the double security deposit in that box, but I need to claim the amount in the area where I write my complaint. So, I have a few questions:

1. Do I put the full amount of the security deposit in the box where it says amount claimed ($1200.00)? Or do I put the amount of the security deposit minus the charges we are not disputing($800.00)?

2. When putting in the amount for double damages, do I subtract the charges before or after I double the amount. For example, would I claim $2000 ($1200 x 2 = $2400 - $400 = $2000), or would I claim $1600 ($1200-$400 = $800 x 2 = $1600)?

Girlfriend was driving my car in Chicago, where she love-tapped someone's front bumper while backing out of a spot.  There was no damage to my car.  He claims his bumper was cracked and basically needs to be replaced.  The post-accident scene was handled badly by both sides.  He took 1 picture of the damage to my car (was actually a pre-existing scratch, but my girlfriend didnt know that), a picture of my licence plate, and a picture of her licence, and they also exchanged phone numbers.  His bumper had very obvious previous damage on it outside of what may have just happened.  Sketchy part No.1: No insurance information was exchanged whatsoever.  Police were not called.  My girlfriend (20) is a nervous wreck while this is all happening, she had never even bumped a car before.  He never said anything about exchanging insurance information.  He was a 30ish year old man driving a car worth at least 10x of what mine is.  I begin to suspect this man doesn't have insurance.  A week or more passes, suspicions seem to be confirmed when...  Sketchy part No.2: He texts said girlfriend about shopping around for a body shop to get estimates for his bumper.  After talking to me, we agree that we should tell him to call his insurance company and send a picture of his damage.  This seems the right thing to do because insurance companies usually know how to handle these things.  He never sends picture.  Again suspicions that he has no insurance and there was no damage caused anyway.  Three weeks pass, suspicions seem to be confirmed again (until today...) Sketchy part No.3: Another text is received, saying that 1. He already sent her a picture of the damage (he didn't), and 2. I should call my insurance company since he was not at fault.

Was I right to be suspicious about his activity, namely not exchanging insurance information, the length of time between communications, the already present damage on his bumper, and his apparent non-willingness to talk to his insurance company?

I met with an estate planning lawyer recently, and she drafted up a will, power of attorney, etc. that I am currently reviewing.

I am somewhat naive about how all this works, but could you kindly let me know what is ""typical"" or standard practice for Trusts?

-----------------------------------

* For the trust itself, once it is set up, how is money put into it?  Is money transferred from all of our accounts into a single account in the trust?  What about stocks that we own in brokerage accounts?  Our house? Is the executor/trustee required to sell these and have cash, or are they just transferred into an account owned by the trust?

* The Will indicates that all interest earned on the principal within the trust is to be distributed each year to the beneficiaries. Is this normal?  Why would it not just accrue?  Do I want a 10 year old receiving tens of thousands of dollars each year?

For background, my wife and I have one child (a 2 year old).  If we both pass away, the trust would be set up and money distributed in three installments when our daughter reaches certain ages. Estate right now is about $3 million once you take into account life insurance proceeds.

I do plan on asking follow-up questions to our attorney, but wanted to try to make them sound somewhat knowledgeable!

5b60e59dda52255c20d04273,"[US] Girlfriend's new job gave no pay stubs, no lunch break, and no bathroom breaks.. To preface, we live in Georgia in the United States. My girlfriend is 19 years old. 

So my girlfriend was offered a job as a manager of a brand new store that was opening up at the beginning of July. This was the second of an already existing store in the town we live in. She was offered the manager position, $12 a hour, at least 40 hours a week, the freedom to make her own schedule, 5% of sales at the end of the year from both stores, and a bonus at the end of year. 

So they hired her and no contracts were signed before or after hiring. No official papers stating what she would be doing or that she worked there at all. She starts the job during her two week notice at her previous job. They ""train"" her, which was really just teaching her how to run the register and computer system and using her for labor. She was told to find employees to run the new store that would open roughly four weeks after she started. So I help her set up an online ad for the position of part time employee and numerous (probably 30) applications came in. 

She reached out to a few applicants to set up interviews only to be told it was completely up to her to hire these employees because they would be splitting her hours with her. So she decided to hire none and no interviews took place. During her time at the pre existing store she worked alone probably 80% of the time. Over 40 hours a week not by choice. 

So the new store opens up. It's a good 40 minute drive to the new location for everyone involved. She's scheduled to work everyday its open for the first week. And she works there with the owners daughter. (The only employees are the owner, owners daughter, my girlfriend, and someone who was hired not long after her to cover at the pre existing location). The daughter mentioned how the other employee would not work at the new location because she ""didn't have the look for it."" The owners daughter is very rude to my girlfriend as well. Always complaining about what she did the night before and telling her she should know how to do her job. The problem with that is, she received very little training if you could even call it that. Every day she would tell me how she got in trouble and sometimes openly in front of customers. 

Then comes the Fourth of July. She's running the store alone and is left a letter from the boss. The letter is two pages long front and back that states she has a learning curve and didn't train well. It also states that the boss never guaranteed 40 hours a week and that she wouldn't receive her bonus or percentage of sales. She even mentioned reducing her hours each week. 

So she texts me the letter and asks her parents and we all agree she should quit the job because it was nothing what they offered her and we felt she wasn't being treated properly. We believe she was used to make the drive to the new store because the owner and her daughter had no interest in doing it daily. That's just a theory however. 

So she texts the owners daughter that she quits and needs to come to the store to take over. She continued to work and help customers and make sales until the owners daughter arrived to relieve her. 

She worked 8-10 hour shifts alone in busy towns. She wasn't given an opportunity to go grab food or take a break. She couldn't use the bathroom unless there were no customers, which was rare and when there weren't she had to run to make sure no one came in. She was never given any pay stubs for any of her checks and in the letter the boss stated that she guesstimates her pay and overtime pay. I correctly calculated her overtime pay and it was double what she was actually paid. 

My question is: what here is illegal - if any of it is. I believe some of it may be and we're curious what we can do about it. Apparently someone heard about what happened to my girlfriend and said the same store and boss and did the exact same thing to another person previously. 

Sorry for the long patchy story. 

tl;dr: Girlfriend was offered a management job at a new store and was given zero management duties. She couldn't take a break to get food and eat and could rarely use the bathroom. Owner and her daughter were rude to her and told her another employee didn't have the look to work at the new store. She received zero pay stubs with checks and was underpaid for overtime hours. She also received a letter claiming she had a learning curve during training when they never properly trained her or worked with her enough to know how she was.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,,0.75

Hi, I just got hired at a bar a couple of weeks ago, and I was asked to sign an employment contract that contained a couple of clauses that I'm a bit apprehensive about. I've worked at many bars and restaurants over the years and I've never had to sign anything like this before, and I'm just wondering what other folks might think before I sign the contract. 

The things that stood out to me were:
- ""Probation: The first six months of employment are a probationary period during which Employer may, in its sole discretion and for any reason, terminate employment without further compensation, notice, pay in lieu of notice, and severance"". I assume this part is probably legal, but I don't find comfort in knowing that I could be terminated for any reason without notice for the first six months...
- ""Confidential Information - you will not at any time divulge, disclose, or communicate to any individual, person, firm, corporation, partnership, or business entity of any time, any information concerning any matter affecting or relating to Employer's enterprise, including business records, business events, daily matters, marketing, operations procedures, passwords, food and beverage development and recipes, menu development, and any financial or business affairs connected thereto. Any breach of this provision causes irreparable harm to Employer, and automatically entitles Employer to, among other remedies, any injunctions required to prevent or restrain such breach by you or any of your partners, co-venturers, employers, employees, servants, agents, representatives, and any other persons or entities acting for or on your behalf.

He has NEVER invited me to a meeting with the head of our dept, when my peers in other depts, all do.  My boss has also said that in order for me to get promoted, I need face time with the head of the dept.  Because he has a 20+ year relationship with this executive, he doesnt want anyone else getting the attention.  

My boss has several others that work for him that manage other groups.  When we had target setting meetings with heads of each dept, I asked if I could attend and he said no one on his team would attend other than him (in other words, he would represent all of us in all meetings) - later I found out, the others did in fact attend the meetings.  Have proof of this in email.  

There was a company open call for nominees to participate in a task force - my boss sent an email to his team asking if any of us were interested.  I said i was, and he later verbally told me I couldn't because I was looking to change depts.  Which makes ZERO sense, and he is just fishing for excuses.  This task force would be me in touch with major players in the organization and I feel like he doesnt want that.  

He has made comments like: ""why is XYZ off today? they want to have a life outside of work?""....""we are glad XYZ left the company, b/c he always had family and kids issues and never worked late""

He has taken his (personal/home related) anger out on me...when I called him out on it, he said he wasn't aware he brought his personal life at work when it was utterly OBVIOUS.

I was on my way home from picking my girlfriend up from work about 3 weeks ago. It was just after 11 pm and I had a friend accompany me since we were hanging out anyways and we wanted to grab a bite to eat after. I pull up to a red left turn arrow and waited for it to turn green, the light proceeds to turn green (green, not flashing yellow, to be clear) so I accelerate to get onto the ramp that heads onto the freeway, halfway across the intersection I see headlights to my right side and half a second later an F350 with a pushbar is shearing through the front end of my car and I'm screaming what the fuck. The airbags did not deploy for whatever reason. I go into emergency mode and tell my passengers to get out of the car, and get to safety since my car was smoking and I didn't know if it would start on fire or not. The other driver (who's truck was totally fine) walked over and admitted fault, I proceeded to bitch at him for being a reckless fucking idiot who could have killed all 3 of us while also contacting police. So the cop shows up, takes mine and my passenger's statements, and goes to talk to the guy who had just gotten off the phone with his boss since it was a work truck.

I took pictures of my car and the intersection, and also took a picture of his license plate and insurance information.

Fast forward yesterday, I finally get a hold of their insurance agent amd she tells me she will send out an adjuster to estimate the damages and whatever else they do so here I am waiting until I get another call from their agent today. Apparently they are denying my claim due to insufficient evidence that it was their drivers fault. I've never been involved in anything like this and I have no idea where to start besides getting a hold of the police report. So I guess my question would be what the hell do I do now?

5b60e59dda52255c20d0433d,"Can I sue a church (Mormon) to recover my donations [Utah, USA]?. TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.

First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.

Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.  

The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.

Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays. 

Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?",0.75,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,,0.25
5b60e59dda52255c20d0432a,"Emotional Support Animal - Now a threat to be Evicted. Hello all, kind of an extension to a previous post. 

Recently, my roommates and I signed a lease and moved into an apartment that has a no pet policy. However, my roommate has an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) that has documentation for given to her by a licensed therapist in the state via telemedicine. We have done research, and found that we do not need to disclose an ESA to our landlord (correct me if I am wrong) under the Fair Housing Act. 

Upon noticing that there was a dog in the unit, the landlord gave us a 3 day notice to cure our ""breach."" My roommate then gave our landlord the letter stating that the dog spotted was an Emotional Support Animal. Even after my roommate sent the letter to our landlord, our landlord asked that we either get rid of the dog, or we will be given an eviction notice. He stated that there is an ""undue burden"" due to having the dog, for the reason that under CA State Law, he must disclose that there was a dog living in the unit to future tenants, possibly harming future business. Is this true?
Following this, he also stated that his attorney told him that we signed a contract under ""false pretenses,"" given that we moved in with a dog, and that this would override any discrimination to an individual with an ESA. 

We have found a place for the dog to stay in the meantime, and want to bring the dog back, as it provides my roommate with the support needed to live not only in the apartment comfortably, but in the college town we live in. To appease our landlord, we have cured our breach. Even after sending him the letter, he told me that 1 of his supposedly 8 attorneys wanted to move forward with an eviction given we did not have the dog off the premise. 

We have submitted a complaint to HUD, hoping that the fact that ESAs do not have to be disclosed upfront will help us out, and that our landlord's action is discriminatory. 

Also, the lease specifies that PETS are not allowed. Because this is an ESA, not a pet, were we ever in breach?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This is my throwaway because obviously. This all happened in NYC.

My ex and I had a tumultuous relationship, we separated in May of 2015 after a year of marriage, a full no-contest divorce followed in early 2016. 

We had a huge wedding (100% her choice/decision, I wanted something smaller and much less grand). Neither of us were making much money at the time, and she had received a large inheritance from her grandmother previously which she used to pay for the wedding. 

When we separated and ultimately divorced we stayed friendly-ish, but she always carried a resentment over the money she spent on the wedding. I told her (though never in a documented format) that should I ever be in a very comfortable financial situation I would be happy to repay her a portion of the wedding fund. 

A little current add on, I am technically homeless, make very little money, and although I have prospects on the horizon by no means could you call my situation comfortable, something closer to strained. 

She emailed me recently about a ""financial situation"" she wanted to discuss with me, after some pressing she explained that she was threatening legal action to recoup half of the cost of our wedding as well as interest starting from our separation in 2015. 

I'm sure the main advice would be to get a lawyer, which is rough as I literally have little to no money. My main curiosity is, is it even possible for her to sue me for that, especially since that's something she would have had to have handled during the divorce, and without any documentation of me stating explicitly ""I will pay you such and such"" does this threat have any real validity? My main assumption is that she's hurting for cash and knowing my situation thinks if she threatens legal action she will be able to squeeze a few pennies from my well.

Jane was not informed not to use the closet. There is no sign. There is no lock on the closet. She stored some luggage and other items in the closet space. Today, while at work, Jane received a text from the landlord, claiming that Jane broke the Central AC by storing things in the attic. 2 of the landlord's text messages:

""The electrician and owner was at the house.  I took out luggage and stuff from the closet yesterday where unit is and he found two more suitcases and hangers.  This caused the air unit to break.  He fixed it but charged me $150.  Please include this charge with your rent check this Friday July 14 and please do not ever store anything else in there.  You can use the garage.""

Recently I started having lots of issues with it and upon further troubleshooting/inspection noticed some of the modular connections on my power supply were melted.

Oddly enough the machine continued to limp along until I made this discovery.

The power supply is a ""high end"" 1000W and had a 5 year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. Was a fairly painless transaction.

My issues persisted even with the new power supply (instability, etc) 

I tried my ram sticks one at a time and the issue continued with all four and so I figured my motherboard had been damaged (in hindsight i should have bought all new ram at the same time)

Being a high end X99 platform it made sense to just replace the motherboard as any kind of an upgrade would be very expensive and not much gain to me as I just use it for office/IT tech work and gaming.

The replacement motherboard did not fix the issue so I started to suspect my ram/processor.

I am awaiting a replacement processor from Intel and new ram from amazon.

John Doe passed away several years ago, and the house he purchased (that we currently live in) was transferred into the John Doe Revocable Trust. The house still has a mortgage that still has John Doe's name (not the trust). The deed of the house according to the county clerk's office has ""John Doe Revocable Trust"" as the owner.

The John Doe Revocable Trust has three trustees - my mom, my sister and I. We have documentation declaring this. 

All three of us have agreed that we would like to have the house just in my name since currently, I'm making the mortgage payments and I have decent credit, and neither my mom nor sister feel they are in a position to be able to take responsibility for the property. 

**What are the steps needed in order to get the house transferred out of being under the Trust's name and just under my name? And, with as minimal cost as possible?**


Here are the steps that I have figured out based on researching, but I would like to know if I am missing something, or if there is something else I need to consider:


1. Find a blank Quit Claim Deed form and fill in the info to show transfer of the property from the Trust (Grantor) to my name (Grantee). 

2. Have all three of us trustees sign the Quit Claim Deed under a Notary.

3. Take Deed Form to County Clerk's Record office to get it recorded. 

4. Submit deed showing new title of ownership to the mortgage bank who can transfer mortgage over to my name. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Questions I have:


1. Are there any tax or other financial implications that I need to be aware of when this transfer happens? (other than fee for recording office, etc.)


2. There seem to be a lot of ""buy a deed form"" websites where you fill in the info then pay $30-$50 to print the form. I'd rather just write one up and format it myself and save the money if I can. Is there any trusted website or place that indicates what language *should* be on the quit claim form?

Probably a little bit different than the usual questions you get here, but, I'm writing a graphic novel and am having some trouble working out part of the plot.  Hope you guys don't mind helping me out.

The apparent scenario goes something like this:  While attending college, one student falls to her death from a high balcony.  The only other student there at the time does not remember what exactly happened (I know, I know,  the amnesia trope is played out, but meh &gt;_&gt;), but evidence suggests there may have been some maintenance issues on the balcony as some of the wrought iron supports or their screws were rusted through.  


That's the available apparent evidence. The actual events as I currently have them go something like this:   The two students were roommates, Roommate 1 (Let's call her Crissy. Not actually her name, but I don't want this post to be easily searchable for spoiler reasons) gets angry at Roommate 2 (Let's call her Amy)  over a misunderstanding and goes to confront Amy where she is located on an upper balcony.  They argue about misunderstanding and Crissy gets physical and attacks Amy. But Amy has self-defense training and redirects her attack such that she ends up pushing Crissy back into the balcony.  Ordinarily this probably wouldn't have been enough force to do anything except deflect the attack, but the balcony was already in a weakened state and it broke enough for Crissy to lose her balance, slip and fall over the edge, colliding with the pavement below. 

I have a few questions; How likely is it such an event would result in a manslaughter charge for Amy? If so, what sort of sentence would she be looking at?  (the plot kind of demands that she be around for the school year after, which is when the story actually takes place so I was hoping for at most maybe several months of actual jail and then probation where she would have to stay on school premises)  Would there even be any charges or is it more likely to be chalked up as an accident.  Would the school be held responsible in some way for the faulty balcony?

Anyway, thanks for your help. :D

We contacted our property management to try and solve the issue with zero response. This week we received a 3 day notice to ""Pay rent or quit""  to which we immediately called the property management company in which the only response they would really give us was ""We don't care who pays it, it just needs to be paid or else there is zero chance you can renew your lease"" Today me and friend A went into the property management company to discuss this situation to which they told us the same thing but also said we should email the head of the property management company because he may possibly find us a way to fix this.

Here's a quick overview of my problem :  
  
I'm French, my girlfriend is American, we've been together for 2 years (she came to France for a year, and i went 2 times to the US for 3 months).  
  
We want to get married and live together in the US, but i currently don't have any visa except for the ESTA 3-months tourist visa.  
  
I came to the US 2 weeks ago with the intent to stay for 3 months, get married, and figure something out to stay here legally.  
  
I ran into some trouble at the border with the officer telling me that i can't apply for any visa after getting married, as this would be illegal.  
  
Fair enough, i explained i just wanted to get married, go back to france after the 3 months and come back again right after to do the visa, at which point he got angry and told me i couldn't even get married on US soil (which is total bullshit based on my researches)  
  
We're not really sure what to do at this point.  
Apparently getting married and acquiring a visa are not seen as a good thing, so maybe i should find a way to get a visa without getting married, and get married afterwards ?  
  
From what i saw there's only 2 visa i could apply for : K-1 and CR1.  
  
For now my gf makes enough money to support both of us, but eventually i'd like to work as well.  
No rush though, for now we simply want to be together, even if i can't work.  
  
Here's my plan for now : Get married, go back to France once my current 3-months visa is expired, apply for a long term tourist visa, go back to the US whenever the tourist visa is approved, apply for a K-1 visa once i'm in the US.

5b60e59eda52255c20d044f8,"Master's Degree - Supervisor Harassment/Abuse of Power [LONG POST]. I am writing this post on behalf of a friend who I know very well and has found himself in a frustrating predicament and is in need of some advice.
Background Story: My friend obtained a grant to carry out and complete a Master's dissertation in Chemistry which he has to finish by September or else risk having to pay the grant himself, which he cannot afford. 
What Happened: My friend was assigned to a completely new tutor/supervisor, lets call her Dr. Smith for simplicity's sake. This is Dr. Smith's first year working at University and is thus supervising her first two students who she is being abusive against.
The problem first started when my friend cordially disagreed with Dr. Smith on how a particular calculation should be worked out - a classical example of a student not agreeing with his teacher and the teacher taking it completely the wrong way (the displacement defense mechanism). 
The latter is just the tip of the iceberg, on several occasions she has called my friend 'stupid' to his face (and even his colleague) in an aggressive tone. Her personality is what I would describe as toxic and straight out abusive. It got to a point where my friend had to be careful of everything that he does, says or asks because of a possible tantrum by Dr. Smith.
This took a toll on my friend so he approached Dr. Smith and told her that she was being too aggressive and was intimidating him. Once again Dr. Smith took it completely wrong, not only was she completely oblivious to how abusive she has been but she accused my friend of being aggressive, not working hard enough and at times, intimidating her. Now I know my friend really well and if I had to describe him I would say that he's extremely passive, smart and hardworking so her accusations genuinely dumbfounded me.
My friend realized that his chat clearly got him nowhere and made things a lot worse. Knowing that he needs Dr. Smith to complete his Master's degree, my friend decided to take the higher road and ""suck up"" to his supervisor so he sent her an apology email, hoping that if he would be the first to reach out and make a compromise to settle their differences Dr. Smith would TRY to do the same. WRONG, she did not even read his email and they got to a point where Dr. Smith kicked him out of the lab and told him that she is not going to work with him anymore.
At this point, my friend is not completely screwed as she won't let him complete his dissertation so he setup a meeting with the faculty Dean to explain things to him which was unfruitful as she ended up 'hijacking' his meeting and turn it into a scolding session against him. 
With no options left he decided to setup a meeting with the disciplinary board and he explained his case quite well in privacy this time and was quite convincing. Dr. Smith also had a meeting with the board and used my friend's apology email as leverage to falsely prove her point. It seems like the disciplinary board is more inclined to believe Dr. Smith because the apology email demonstrated my friend’s guilt (from their point of view) rather than the fact that he was willing to take the higher road as he is in need off of his tutor (however crazy she is).

My question now is, if the disciplinary board decided to side with Dr. Smith, what else can my friend do or who else should he turn to? The situation that he's in is not only unjust because he's going to be robbed of a Master's degree which he's so close to finishing but also because he will have to pay for the grant that he worked so hard to obtain, all because of a person who has personality issues and is good at hiding it/lie about it during disciplinary meetings.
Should he find a legal advisor or attorney considering that he’s broke? Does he stand a chance in tribunal or court? Is taking legal action even worth it?

5b60e59eda52255c20d04559,"Building Trustee Threatening Lawsuit. I live in New York (upstate) with my partner.  He got a one year lease for an apartment and I was on it as someone staying there, not as the lessee or sublessee. (kinda stupid, I know, but I'm not letting it happen again lol)
Our landlady died in February, and shortly thereafter a man moved in with his sisters.  The local PD posted on Facebook that sister 1 is a level three sex offender.  She didn't disclose it on any forms and the new landlord had no idea, which I'm pretty sure isn't legal on her part.  All three siblings are addicted to cocaine and heroin, and they constantly brought their dealer into their apartment which was above mine.  I hated it, but it didn't seem like a problem to me because it was quiet and contained.  However, it quickly went downhill, and I've had to call the police on them 7 separate times now - threatening each other with knives, pushing people down the stairs, throwing a TV out of their third story window and onto my neighbor's car, etc - and I repeatedly tried telling the new landlord that the new tenants made it unlivable, but he told me his ""hands are tied.""  The lease did have a clause saying we have the right to peaceably and quietly enjoy the rented property, and my brief chat with an attorney about this led me to believe that because I couldn't live there SAFELY (neighbors banged on my door in the middle of the night, tried opening my windows from the outside, one tried kicking down the door), let alone quietly, we weren't obligated to pay rent until the landlord sorted everything out.  We made numerous attempts to tell the landlord about the situation and he always acted like he couldn't do anything.  We continued living there until we moved out shortly thereafter, and didn't pay rent for the last two months (our lease ends this month.)  
Everything seemed to have blown over when just recently, the building's trustee started calling me and requesting to talk to me about my ""intentions"" without ever calling my SO, who actually signed the lease.  I never answered because I've heard horror stories about her from other tenants, until today when I finally decided to answer and get it over with.  I asked why she didn't call the person who's actually on the lease and she told me to ""mind my own business,"" then called me an ""ignorant child"" when I explained what the attorney had told me.  She then screamed a little bit and told me her attorney will be in contact with me shortly.
Who's in the right?  Where do I go from here?
Tl;dr: crackheads made the apartment unlivable so I didn't pay rent and moved out, now the trustee is threatening legal action for the rent.  How badly did we fuck up?",,0.25,,,,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.75,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,,0.25

I really don't know anything about LLC/trademark/copyright. In all likelihood, the app won't take off. But let's just assume it does. What should I do legally for protection against whatever it is that could happen? I've read some answers around the web about how I should create a second Google account to release on (if Google had a problem with my app they could disable the account it was uploaded with, and that could be my personal account). So I know to do that. But what else should I be doing? I want to be making revenue from the app via ads + in app purchases, but I have no idea how that works legally.

5b60e59eda52255c20d045b4,"(USA-MA)Traffic Ticket Law, 3 Charges/$515, is a lawyer worth it? + General Advice please.. I would like to state that I am appealing this ticket with or without a lawyer, and I am asking for advice on my best course of action.

There was a crazy amount of traffic where I had to drive today.  There was the usual Tourist traffic for people heading down to the cape, alongside the typical traffic, and also a funeral procession clogging things up.

I was in a position where to travel at a safe speed of 75 mph (speed limit is 65mph, but the average travelling speed is between 70-80mph) I had to change lanes frequently.  My goal was to get around the funeral procession travelling at 65 mph in the middle lane, and to not get trapped behind the individuals travelling 70mph in both the left and middle lane (the person in the right hand lane was not passing, and was in fact slowing down for some reason).  I had to change lanes numerous times, but did so using my turn indicator and while paying attention to where my vehicle was.

I observed a state trooper fly up the highway with damage to his driver's side front end.  I was currently in the right hand lane, to the right of the two cars travelling at 70 mph.  He had his lights on, and as I pulled over he pulled over VERY close, and I pulled forward another foot or so to avoid being struck.

I pull out my licence, wait for the cop.  He reaches in and takes it without a word from either of us.  He comes back and hands me the ticket without saying anything else, he was positioned in a way where it was hard for me to look at him or see anything.  I say thank you, he gets in his vehicle and leaves, with me stuck in the breakdown lane in heavy traffic for 2 miles.

Tl;dr I was trying to get around really slow and distracted drivers, did so in a way that was a bit rushed, and a state trooper who was obviously having a bad day gave me a ticket without so much as a 'Do you know why I pulled you over?'

-----
The ticket states...

89-4A Weaving x6 $105

89-4A Unsafe Lane Change x3 $105

90/17 95 in a 65 with no boxes checked (Posted, Not Posted, Clocked, Lidar, Radar, Estimated)

I know 100% that I wasn't travelling at 95 miles per hour.  I was at most 80-85, and only so I could pass the traffic that was inconsistently between 60-75.

I do not have the best record, I had a similar ticket 4 years ago (which is the last spot on my record, which goes away in 5 months).  With that said, my record has been improving over time.

My question here is, is a traffic lawyer going to do me any favors, or is it not worth the time?  I was quoted $700 flat from a lawyer earlier today, which would make sense long-term if this entire ticket gets dismissed, but I am not sure if that would even happen.

How much more likely is the case going to be dismissed/reduced with a lawyer present than if I represented myself?  I am capable of looking up laws, cleaning up my appearance, and get to the court on time.  With the information above, if you can offer any insight it would be appreciated.  I have never been to court before (no criminal record, never fought a ticket) and want to do my best.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.75,,0.25

Me and my fiance lived here for 3 months, the roof was leaking also the ceiling was leaking into the stove, which would smoke when turned on the oven part of it so we're scared to use it. The porch is also water damaged along with me almost falling through it.  The wall at the part of the house thats leaking is taking in water also, i put my hand on it one day to walk down the 1 foot apart death trap steps to the water leaking basement only to have the wall cave in a bit and i could hear stuff falling down it, the house wasn't inspected or anything before we moved in, we had to buy a steam cleaner and clean the nasty carpet, also painted the bedroom and re-did the flooring as well.  They never fixed anything other than putting a tarp on the roof, and has never done anything about it for a month now. 

Every time we have asked our landlord (daughter) about anything she just told us to talk to her dad about it, and then he woudn't want to do anything. We were promised gutters and a back fence that never got put up, not worried about the fence but the gutters would prevent all the water leaking into the basement and the chance for mold and whatnot, we can't use the entire house as it is and they haven't fixed anything.

We've decided not to pay rent this month and have a lease being printed out for us on the new place and are using that to put down on the deposit and rent for the new place.

They just showed up asking for the rent and we told them we didn't feel we should have to pay this month being that i can't even use the entire house and that we're moving out soon around the end of the month. 

I have taken pictures of everything and have tried to also save any conversations me and my fiance have had with this guy and his daughter.  Are we in the wrong? Should we pay rent, even though nothing got done?  My fiance is scared about going to court because they're saying they're going to put up a 5 day notice on our house and then start the eviction prosess, i mean we're gonna be gone by then but we will still have to deal with them in court.

My age, name, when I'm planning to move, how many people, etc. It seemed a tiny bit strange that he would ask me about my age but I brushed it off. At the bottom of the email he gave me the address to the home. I google mapped it and it looks NOTHING like the home that was pictured on the website where I found the rental. I looked up the address and apparently it's ""pending"" on a SELLER. Now it's getting weird. The guy says it's for rent but yet the same exact house is on SALE on several other websites.

""Please go and take a look at the outside of the house first, and then come back to me if you like the house, so I can send the keys. The keys and documents will be sent to you through courier, which will be delivered in a few hours and we will need your postal address as well.

I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me.

There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire. 

Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires. 

The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women).

5b60e59eda52255c20d046e9,"How would I go about purchasing a piece of my neighbor's property?. Hello all!
I live in a house in CT that has a somewhat unusual arrangement regarding the driveway. When we purchased the house, we were given an almost 30 year old agreement between two former owners, who agreed to ""grant each other mutual access"" to their yards for the sum of $1. The property line between the two houses runs lengthwise down the driveway. The yards can only be reached through the driveway or through the houses themselves. The lawyer who helped closed on our house told us that technically, as per the arrangement, both us and our neighbors could block each other from parking a car in the driveway, and that the arrangement concerns access to the yard, not use of the space in the driveway itself. So, I own half, my neighbors own half, and we split the driveway down the middle. 

They are considering selling the house and I'm thinking of approaching them about extending my property line to the edge of their house. Of course I would grant the new owners the same arrangement, whereby we can both access our yards from the driveway. Is there anything I'd want to keep in mind here? Legally, this was a strange-sounding arrangement to me, and I'm not sure what my options are or what the process is.

5b60e59eda52255c20d04733,"My company got bought by a bigger one, many of my colleagues got offered share options, I did not. Still have a low salary, and job title was degraded (London, UK). Hi All,

So apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, but I wasn't sure where else to turn, and didn't know if I had any legal options here.

So in a nutshell, I've been with my company for just over 3 and a half years. During that time I've had a few pay rises, but nothing too dramatic - started on £20k, year later £24k, year later £28k. I know that sounds like quite big jumps, but I've gone above and beyond for these guys - worked loads of (unpaid) hours of overtime, and considering how much I do for them, it's low for what I should be paid (many of my colleagues have told me this).

So it came to the time of year for the meeting I have to discuss my future/salary. Only this time they say they can't pay me any increase, due to changes at the company. Instead, they say they'll offer 'profit share' to us. What this meant, was a small percentage of our profits would come to me every quarter, this worked out to about £800/quarter. So not a great deal, but better than nothing. I tell them I'm invested in the company, I want to be here for the long haul, and if they can't offer me money, I'd be more than happy to take share options in the company. They didn't give me an answer on this.

Fast forward 6 months - we're told the company is being bought out. I organise a meeting to stress that I'm really due a pay rise (or share options) and stress that I don't want to start at the new place on a low salary, as that'll make me seem like a low level employee to them. They say they can't do anything until we start at the new place. 

At the new place, they say we're all going to keep our jobs, and the salary will be in line with what we've had before. I'm offered £29k (so a £1k increase). Not great. My title changes from Production Manager to 'Creative Accountant Executive') - which does also feel like a step down. I'm told we'll have a meeting in the coming weeks to discuss this all, but I'm eating fed up of waiting by this point.

Anyway, we start a the new place. It's pretty cool, much the same as my last place, exact same kind of job, with some new duties. I go down the pub that night to discuss how it was for my colleagues, and they tell me something interesting - they were all offered share options in the new company (shares at a discounted cost). They got offered more depending on seniority, and if they didn't want to take them, they were offered a bonus. Admittedly, I'm the youngest of them  - the next oldest colleague has been with them just over 5 years. But he was offered in the region of £50k. Which seems a lot. Maybe I'm missing something,I don't claim to know all the details -  but should I not have been even considered for this? Do I have any legal precedent to stand on?

5b60e59eda52255c20d0475e,"Car Towed and Possible Police Misconduct/Targeting?. Currently, I live with my bf who owns 2 vehicles. Unfortunately, our apartment complex only allows one parking spot per person living in the apartment. I have 1 car and my boyfriend has 2 which obviously leaves us one space short. The next part of the story is super important, at the time of move in and multiple times afterwards (via email as well as verbal) the apartment complex I currently live in told us that the street across from our apartment is a public street meaning that we could park our extra vehicle on that street without paying for an additional spot. That was what we thought was the end of that. Additionally, at least 20-30 cars park on this street daily as spill over from our complex.

My boyfriend primarily uses one car over the other; however, both cars have been used throughout the 8 months we have lived there and we have never had issues up until this point. 

A little bit of background on a separate incident but related in the sense that the same officer has issued all the tickets to the vehicle in question:

On 12/16/2016 my boyfriend received a parking ticket for being ""more than 12 inches away from the curb"". Not really thinking to take a picture of the vehicle before moving it, accepted the ticket and paid the appropriate fee.

Back to the current story:

After running into my neighbors and talking to them about what happened everyone I talked to had similar stories! I figured ""I guess this is how the police deal with their time in a sleepy town and while annoying parking tickets are apart of life"". I sent an email to my leasing office explaining the situation and the leasing office sent a reply saying their policies are their policies and to their understanding we are legally allowed to park on that street. I still have a copy of this email for my own records.

On 06/08/2017 we received a warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location (I do have this warning but it is not with me. I can upload this ticket late if need be). So not thinking much of it, my boyfriend moved the vehicle a couple of streets over with additional public parking(which I pass on my way to work everyday and can visually see the windshield and would noticed any ticket or warning).

On 06/29/2017 on my way to work I noticed that the car was not in it's normal ""spot"" which I check daily on my way to work. I sincerely make it a point to check everyday as we almost missed the deadline to pay for the first ticket due not seeing the ticket. I frantically call my boyfriend and explain whats going on. At first we thought the car had been stolen but after looking online realized it could have been towed. We contacted the local tow company and sure enough that was the case.

We promptly went to go retrieve the car; however; because the police department was the one who issued the tow, we could not retrieve the car until we have payed the associated fees with the police department. Great. At this point we were livid as we had never received any notification that car was going to be towed. 

We go to the police department and to our utter shock there were apparently 2 outstanding parking tickets for ""parking without permission on public property"" (WTF does that even mean?!?!) and that we had received ANOTHER warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location. Outraged we said we were never notified of the tickets or the second warning to move the vehicle (The tickets are bright pink and I visually check the windshield daily and would have noticed these tickets/warning) and would be appealing them but unfortunately we were told we had to pay the additional associated fees if we wanted to retrieve the car from the impound lot. Additionally, we stated we had moved the vehicle after the first ""dead"" vehicle warning so clearly it was not a dead vehicle. The clerk stated all she could do was give us the tickets and pay the fee but if we wanted to appeal the tickets we would have to submit additional paperwork (we have the paperwork and are currently filling it out). 

We then retrieved the car which had NO PARKING TICKETS ON THE WINDSHEILD and after getting home a reviewing the tickets realized ALL THE TICKETS WERE ISSUED BY THE SAME OFFICER!!! Including the first parking tickets we received in December.

I have no clue if what is going on is illegal or not and I am just really looking for advice on how to move forward. This situation does not read right to me and after everything is all said and done (and if we end up having to pay the tickets) we will have sunk 1k into this whole ordeal.

I can't help but to feel we were specifically targeted as about 20-30 people park on the street across from our complex all the time and never get towed. My head is spinning and the idea that a police officer can get away with what has happened sickens. I'm also having a hard time stomaching a 1k loss without any idea on how to prevent it in the future as my bf was about to go to college and we had to dip into that money to cover this expense.

- She's pretty sure she wasn't sent a new lease agreement for this year (I'm not sure when her lease year was up). If she's right, she doesn't have the protection of a lease.

- She has never received a mailed notice, just email.

5b60e59eda52255c20d047aa,"Need help understanding probate process for small estate. Hello, looking for some advice about the probate process for a small estate in the state of Arkansas. I've read up on what to do but I am still confused. Trying to understand if I need to go through probate court, or if this can just be solved through Arkansas's small estate process. I feel like this should be straightforward, so hopefully someone has some answers or recommendations. 

My mother passed away last month. My father passed away 11 years ago, and I only have one (younger) brother.

I am named in her will as the executor of the will. My brother and I are listed in the will as beneficiaries, splitting any assets 50/50. 

Her assets that are part of the estate are as follows:
Checking account &amp; savings account, together totalling about $3K
11 year old van which she didn't owe money on, worth $1K at most

Assets that have my brother and I named as beneficiaries (so they shouldn't count towards in the probate process, right?):
Life insurance policy for about $40K
IRA account, about $30K
401K account, about $7K
Another savings account, has about $200

Debts:
Student loans, at least $20K
Chase credit card, about $2K
Not aware of others but will be running a credit report soon to confirm

From what I've read, her estate qualifies as a small estate in Arkansas, since it's worth less than $100K. So it should bypass probate court, and I simply need to file an affidavit of small estate. However, on the form for the affidavit of small estate, one of the stipulations for filing as a small estate is ""There are no unpaid claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate."" This is where I am confused. Chase wants to make a claim against the estate. If they make a claim, her assets are enough to cover the amount of their claim...so I assume I would need to pay them from the estate. However, I can't get the funds from her bank account to pay the claim without filing this affidavit. So how the heck am I supposed to pay them? Do I have to go through the probate court simply because there is a claim against her estate? I don't believe I should pay it out of my own pocket, it's not my debt. So it should come out of the estate. I'm just so confused about what to do next.",0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.75,0.25,,0.25,,0.25,0.25,0.25,,0.25,,0.25
5b60e59eda52255c20d047d8,"Camp not paying for teaching services- what's my next step?. I am a certified teacher and was offered a position teaching at a performance arts summer camp for 5 weeks for 2k. I could bring my child so it was really ideal for summer pay. Since taking the position, basically everything has turned out to be a lie. I was supposed to teach Pre-K. Instead I'm teaching PreK-2nd grade all in one classroom.

Okay cool, part of being a teacher is being flexible and making it work- I can do that. Also the number of campers was supposed to be 100, and instead there's 45 at best. We're also in a low socioeconomic area in my city where many of the parents just haven't paid and we're finishing week 3.

Payday is supposed to be this Friday with half of my pay due. I wasn't feeling very confident about her reliability with paying so I asked her today. She basically said she doesn't have it but has around 1/3 of it. Meanwhile we started with around 6 teachers and are now down to only 2 because everyone else has quit or was told the camp was ""closing"" because basically she couldn't afford to pay them.

If she doesn't pay Friday, I'm done. Both myself and the other remaining teacher will not be returning if she doesn't pay us. I've been flexible with a smile on my face and she's so worried about a final performance that it's literally trumping the fact that half the kids in the main roles haven't even paid to come to camp.

My father's condition grew worse over the next couple months and my mother requested for him to be admitted to the ER for further examination.

5b60e59eda52255c20d0484c,"So I fucked up and am being sued over an online review - how should I handle this?. Firstly, yes I realize I fucked up and what I did was dumb. I did it out of spite and anger which makes it's doubly a bad decision.

**Location:** Texas, USA

**Quick Background:** I rented an apartment from an acquaintance who uses a particular management company. After some weeks I realised that I needed to move outside of the country and asked to end the lease early. The contract stated that I could do that without fees if I found a replacement tenant. So, I tried to and the company managing the property made my life hell for many weeks by doing every shady thing possible to make sure I failed (lying to prospective tenants, turning others away without reason, etc). In the end the landlord, who was being lied to by them as well stepped in and told them to stop fucking around and they finally relented and accepted a tenant. They were hoping I would leave without finding one so they can charge me to find a replacement tenant instead.

Once I moved out, I was very angry and wrote a few negative reviews online using my own accounts and some others. I knew a tenant review doesn't hurt, so I proceeded to write reviews as if I was a property owner who worked with them and the management company stole from me, charged my tenant fees without informing me, and so on. Unfortunately one of the accounts I used is my personal account (dumb x 2), so it can easily be identified as me trying to hurt their reputation by creating a false story. 

**Current Situation:** I currently live abroad and will not be back in the states until December. A few days my parents received notice from the Constable that I was being sued. I wasn't positive it was them, but had a feeling so I quickly took down the review that was most damaging and the one that is under my name directly. Yesterday I got a hold of the constable and he confirmed this managing company is indeed the one suing me. He gave me the details for their lawyers, who I called and left a message for saying I am currently abroad and they can contact me via email.

There are still a couple of facebook reviews that are up, but not exactly 'false'. And another false review on google, but that one cannot be linked to me. I intend to take those down, but am not sure whether to do it now or after they contact me.

I have not been served yet, as I am abroad. Not sure if they can and/or are planning to serve me in another way and if I should be avoiding this at all?

My biggest question is - should I contact the management company directly saying something along the lines of ""I've been notified that you are suing me. I can only assume that it is for the 2 facebook reviews you do not agree with. If that is it, please withdraw your lawsuit and I will take down any reviews that were made by me"" ?

I am not sure if they want to hurt me financially or just want me to take down the negative reviews - which I am happy to do as I now realize it was a dumb thing to do, even if they are a less than honest company who tried to screw me over.

I work for the Federal government, and my agency is headquartered in Washington, DC.  According to the agency's internal website, we have a Disability Office whose role is to help disabled employees determine reasonable work accommodations with their managers. 


**PAST EXPERIENCE:** A few years ago, I was injured and needed ""reasonable work accommodations"" to enter and leave my office building, because it was not wheelchair accessible.  Of the Disability Office, Mr.X, wrote me *in writing* that the office's role was *not* to assist disabled employees and Managers, but to file paperwork for OPM.  My manager and I stopped working with this office and tried to figure this out on our own.  At the time, I was in too much physical pain and not in Washington, DC, so I wasn't able to figure out how to escalate this.


**PRESENT EXPERIENCE:** Fast forward to the present, I have another medical issue requiring ""reasonable work accommodations.""  Against my desire, I was forwarded to the same Disability Office. And then was told I was assigned to work again with Mr. X.  I emailed his Manager and requested a transfer, sharing his prior communication. The Manager disregarded my request, stating the office now cares about customer service, and Mr X is timely with his reports.  Subsequently, Mr. X emailed me, claiming to be ""delighted"" to meet and work with me, and asked me to fill out more forms. 


I am distraught that I will again waste precious time and resources to work with Mr. X when I need to focus on my health. But this time, I'm now back in Washington, DC, and would like to be prepared to bring this to a lawyer, if needed.  


How shall I best document my interaction with Mr. X, especially if this needs to be taken to a lawyer?  In my reply back, should I acknowledge the past communication? I don't want to lie, and claim I look forward to working with him, because then they could claim that I was satisfied with his prior help.... does this make sense?

Every day at 4:00pm my college campus posts available on-campus housing contracts for sale at an online webpage. There is a huge shortage of contracts for students (and nearby off-campus housing is expensive) so the demand is huge and getting one of these contracts is like winning the lottery. I attend a private university.

I wrote a internet bot that refreshes the housing page 30+ times per second and reserves a contract the instant it appears. I successfully used it on myself to get a housing contract. I feel like if I released my bot as a service there would be a big demand for it. Something like ""Pay $50 to guarantee a contract"".

What things should I consider from a legal perspective before launching this type of service? I would need to collect their login information, log in on behalf of the student, and use my bot to put the contract on hold. I wouldn't need to actually pay for or sign any sort of lease agreement for the student. They would finalize the contract after later logging into their account.

In other words, could this be illegal? How should I know if this could get me in trouble with my college? Is it a bad idea to talk to the college directly? Are there other business models that could minimize my risk to legal repercussions?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75,,,

Asking on behalf of a friend who doesn't really know what to do and is so shell shocked by the situation they don't seem to be thinking straight. I'll give the facts as they have been told to me.

I'll start out by saying all of these events have occurred and this friend has never been and has yet to be officially charged of any crime. 
 
-A friend has been accused of sex with a minor, but neither the name of the accuser, the accuser's parents or the prosecutor have been given to this friend or their lawyer. 
-Event supposedly took place in a different city while on a trip with family and SO.
-The police came to their home to investigate this accusation and arrested said friend. 
-During the raid, the police took the xbox, the modem and computer, did not take the hard drive or various flash drives that were within plain sight.
-Friend has been required to check in weekly with their police department.
-Friend was not required to give up his passport.
-Friend has alibi for the time this event was supposed to have taken place, however a time line was established where they went to the store and was not with family or SO for a small period of time. This was told to the police by SO. 
-Friend is not currently working, though there appears to be no reason not to. 
-Police contacted friend's boss and told them that what the friend is accused of and recommended they be terminated.
-Friend has no internet or cell phone access- not sure if personal choice or mandated.
-Due to ""Lack of evidence"" Friend was informed that the case has been ""Postponed indefinitely""
however, they haven't had clear confirmation that they don't need to check in every week, so they still are and Friend's SO received a phone call yesterday by investigators asking for more information on the statement they gave at time of arrest.
-Friend and SO had an upcoming trip planned and were told they could probably check in remotely, but no clear instruction given on how or that it was OK. Trip has since been cancelled. 
-Friend is STILL not working and now lives with this hanging over them.
 
My question is: What sort of things should their lawyer be fighting for on their behalf? Don't they have the right to know who the accused is or at least the accused's representative? Can the lawyer file for something or ANYTHING to free them from the oppression of this uncertainty hanging over their head? Can they have this wrapped up or thrown out or something so that my friend can at least move forward and live a fairly normal life? From my point of view, it appears that their lawyer has done literally nothing and said there is nothing they can do."" 
Furthermore, as all believe this case to be untrue, and indeed lack of evidence seems to support this, how can friend strike back or stand up for themselves so as to minimize damage to their character and reputation within the community?

I am of the belief that my friend needs a new lawyer, I would like to advise them to get a new one, but wanted to see if anyone could tell me how their lawyer is failing them first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,,,,,,

Around February of this year I was contacted by a friendly acquaintance I had known for years asking me if they could stay with me for a convention in the area that we would both be vendors at. I told them that sure, they could, and I had no problem with it. Convention comes and goes, and then about a week afterwards there was some fallout and we decided to go our separate ways. 

The fallout had nothing to do with the convention but of a personal matter. 

This person made it clear in no uncertain terms that they didn't want to have anything to do with me anymore, and I respected that wish and never contacted them again. 

I've never once talked about this person online, blasting them, or even ""vaguebooked"" about them.

During the time this was happening, and every few weeks like clockwork, this person would send me some very nasty texts and emails, commenting on what a horrible person I was, etc. I never replied (in kind or at all) and just let them rant and rave. It finally died down a bit until this last week.

Here's where the income thing comes in. 

We're both members of a fairly niche convention circuit. There's about half a dozen shows over the next few months we're both supposed to be vendors at. As far as I was concerned, the matter was closed; I sell my stuff, you sell yours, and we have the professionalism to ignore each other and get on with our lives.

Two days ago I got a very long text message filled with more ""commentary"" and a threat that if this person sees me at the next show, that ""there will be trouble."" I have no intention of interacting with this person and I finally broke my silence and emailed them, stating that I had no desire to have anything to do with them, but I wasn't going to cancel my spots at the next few shows just because they were going to be there. I also stated that they were not to contact me again, and if they did, I would consider it harassment and do what I needed to legally protect myself. I blocked this person on all social media, blocked their email, and blocked their number from my phone. 

I got over this whole thing months ago, and I've already moved on from it chalking it up to a lesson learned.

This morning I have a few showrunners for this next event and a few after it contact me to ""get my side of the story"" because this person is now reaching out to them saying they feel threatened by me. In short, they're trying to get me booted as a vendor from these shows. If this happens, I stand to lose a lot of speculative income, and I'll lose the very *real* income of the thousands of dollars I've paid to secure my spot at these shows.

This person has more ""pull"" in the circuit than I do. They've been doing it for a few years and I've only been doing it for a little over one, and upon doing some digging, they have indeed gotten people banned from shows. I don't know the circumstances behind those, but I do know it's been done.

I'm unsure what to do here. I've taken a lot of written abuse from this person (all of which I've saved) off and on for months now but simply let it roll off my back because I've had other things to focus on and I never made any reply to any of it until the email I sent last night.

This convention circuit is a source of secondary income for me but it is the *only* income this person gets. I'm not trying to get this person banned from any shows ""before they get me banned"" because I absolutely *do not* want their income to be affected. I was willing to let all the verbal abuse go, but now this person is seriously making threats that could affect my income.

I just want to be able to sell my stuff in peace. That's all.

I paid my first three months in advance as a sign of good faith, and lived here since. My last position ended in November of 2016, and I didn't have a job until May. Obviously, being unemployed made it hard, even with a roommate and girlfriend, to always make the rent and bills. (my girlfriend had her own place til May, roommate moved out in may.) In March, april, and May, I paid the rent before the fifth of the month; in part because the 1st fell on a weekend. I was a week late in June and July because my new position and bills and my car dying made money extremely tight. I had originally signed a lease from january 2016-january 2017, but because he was busy, we didn't resign the new one until march, so it goes until march 2017. I cant' find a paper copy, but I was under the impression there were no late fees until the fifth. As of July 9th, my landlord basically let his brother be in charge, as he didn't want to do the landlord thing anymore. As of the 12th, out of nowhere, he sent me a letter saying I owe 175 in back rent (late fees) for march to july, or I must vacate the property by the 22nd of July.

5b60e59fda52255c20d07023,"[Pittsburgh] Landlord is threatening to cut power and keep security deposit if I don't move out a month before my lease ends. September of last year my roommate and I signed a lease for an apartment in Bloomfield. Communication with the landlord up to this time has been sparse to nonexistent (he has NEVER responded to a maintenance request and I still do not have a key to my mailbox after sending multiple inquiries), and additionally the apartment was damaged when we moved in (stains on carpet, peeling wallpaper, holes in window screen). Our lease runs until 1PM on August 30th.

In March he asked if we would be renewing our lease and, since we were both deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience, we told him we would be seeking housing elsewhere for the following year, and he began listing and showing the apartment.

We did not hear from him again until May 15th. He told us that he had sold the apartment to renters ""would like to get in earlier, perhaps as much as a month earlier"" (I'm quoting his email to me and my roommate directly). Neither of us had settled on housing yet (we were both actively looking for apartments, but, you know. It's Pittsburgh.) so both told him we couldn't give him a concrete move-out date and would let him know ASAP.

On June 6th, he talked to me in person and I gave him the same answer. He claims he also talked to my roommate, although my roommate cannot recall if this happened for sure. Late last month, my roommate and I had both signed leases for new apartments - the earliest possible move-in date for his August 3rd, mine August 5th. I emailed our landlord with these dates and asked if we could pay only a portion of the rent for August since we would be out in the first week. Much like every other email either of us has sent to him, we never heard a response.

Last week (July 6th), he sent an email demanding that we vacate the apartment entirely by August 1st, as the new renters would be moving in. Obviously this came as a shock to both of us. One of my family members is a lawyer, so I sent her a copy of my lease and screencaps of all relevant email communications with the landlord. She agreed that this was illegal, and sent my landlord an email telling him as much (but in formal legalese). I also got in touch with the renters and explained the situation - they told me they were as shocked as I was, because they didn't want to move in early; rather, the apartment had been *advertised* as being open August 1st, and they had not yet signed a lease. Lawyer relative advised me and my roommate not to have any further communication without her input.

Landlord calls me today angrily demanding an explanation. (As I said my lawyer relative advised I stop communicating, but) I told him what I'd already told him - that I couldn't be out any earlier than August 5th. He gave me the same ultimatum - that I had to be out by August 1st, or he would cut power and service to the apartment. Additionally he says he will keep our security deposit if we are not out.

tl;dr Shitty landlord is trying to force me and my roommate out 30 days before my lease ends; lawyer has confirmed this is illegal and told landlord so, but landlord persists.

These are my questions:

1. Should I be preparing to go to court? Lawyer is family, so she wrote the email to my landlord for free. Should I look into hiring a lawyer?

2. Is it legal for a landlord to retain a security deposit for reasons other than damage to the apartment?

3. If it is illegal for him to retain the deposit (as I said, there was damage to the apartment before we moved in, and I have no doubt he will blame us for it if he can), can I demand receipts from the landlord as proof that the security deposit went toward repairing the apartment?

5b60e59fda52255c20d071a3,"Problem with a landlord over parking. Hi, I am currently living in Chicago, IL with one other roommate. We just recently moved into a new place July 1st and I ran into some issues with the landlord. I was guaranteed a parking spot on the lease, and when I signed a lease with them the property manager told me there are 2~3 spots available in the garage so I can park whichever that's empty. They told me they are not sure which parking spot is available at the moment and they told me they will get back to me once they find out.

When I moved into the apartment, I saw a spot open so I parked there over the long weekend following 4th of July. I felt guilty parking in a random spot so I asked the property manager to let me know where my exact parking spot is. Since it was a holiday weekend, they got back to me pretty late and told me that I can park at parking spot #5 which is empty. I moved my car on July 5th to spot #5 until my neighbor came knocking on my door. He claimed that its his parking spot and politely asked me to move my car. He told me since he is moving out at the end of the month, I should try to take his spot once he leaves. I immediately called my property manager, who told me that there was a mistake, and that I should park at parking spot #10. I went down to the garage and checked spot #10 and there was no way I could fit my car in the spot. The spot was isolated from all other spots and it was impossible to fit my car there. I tried parking there numerous times but that only left my car with dents and scratches from my attempts. I called my property manager and told her that my car would not fit in there and asked her if she could either assign a different tenant to the parking spot and switch spots with me, or pay for a different parking garage until next month when my neighbor moves out so I can take spot #5. The property manager said she will ask the other tenants and will get back to me. I waited until night time but she never got back to me. So I left her a text message asking for a solution, but I never heard back. I didn't want to be a nuisance to my neighbor so I moved my car out of my garage and parked on the streets for the night. 

The next day, I still haven't heard anything from my property manager so I texted her again. She simply responded ""I haven't heard back from the tenants"". I asked her for a solution asap since my car got a parking ticket overnight for parking on the streets. She never replied again, so in the afternoon I left her a text message asking if she could pay for a difference in parking fee if I parked at a different parking garage, if she doesn't get back to me by EOD today. She never responded again. Since I did not want to get another parking ticket, I went and got a spot from different parking garage and texted her that I did so and I expect to receive some form of reimbursement from them. She finally responded by saying she had a family emergency and that unfortunately she cannot reimburse anything else but the original parking cost at the apartment. We had few text messages going back and forth, disputing over this issue and in the end I asked her to provide me a different contact information that I can talk to this issue about. 

The next morning I received a call from a different property manager at the company. She claimed that she is sorry for the issue I am going through, and she said she will ask the owner of the apartment if any reimbursement can be made. I asked her if I could possibly have the parking spot #5 next month when my neighbor's lease ends but she said she cannot guarantee it. I questioned the reason of ambiguity and later she agreed that I should get the parking spot #5 before anyone else since its on first come first serve basis.

After that call I forwarded her my receipt for other parking space and waited couple days. I haven't heard back anything for 5 days so I sent her a follow up email. She did not respond so I sent her another follow up email today, and got a response back from the original property manager. She said unfortunately she cannot make any reimbursement other than the original parking fee, and that she is not sure if I can get the parking spot #5 next month. I asked her what the reason is, and she called me on the phone for the response.

She explained that all unit leases are linked with parking spots and apparently my unit is linked to parking spot #10. She said all other tenants' leases specifies the parking spot number except for mine that just says ""assigned. $/month."" She said the leasing agents messed up when they made the lease and it should've included the spot # on the lease but it didn't. She also mentioned that its not her fault since the leasing agent was supposed to show my parking spot before I moved into the place, but this did not happen. I asked her why can't she just switch my parking spot with a new tenant, and she responded that the leasing agents already showed the new place and told the applicants that spot #5 is what they will be getting once they move in. She confirmed that as of today, no lease has been signed yet. I asked her multiple times if she could change the parking spots for me but she said she cannot guarantee anything. 

After the call, I contacted my neighbor and asked if the lease actually stated the parking spot # for them. He confirmed that it did, and that they actually had spot #10 on their lease until he asked the property manager to change the spot for them. He said he was able to change the spot from #10 to #5 on their lease. I was absolutely astounded how they were able to easily change my neighbor's parking spot, but not mine. I am yet to take any action from here and am wondering if I could possibly file a lawsuit against my landlord for a breach of contract or any applicable crime.

Sorry for such a long thread of text, and I very much appreciate your effort of reading this post. I feel like this is so unfair to me and I really need some advice on what actions I should take next.  Please let me know if anyone could provide me with an advice.

5b60e59fda52255c20d07189,"How to react to a restraining order filed with false reasons in Georgia?. A former tenant, a married couple, have filed a restraining order against my father in law, claiming he harassed them by driving past their home. The woman further claimed that she was afraid of him, because he was acting crazy and laughing maniacally.  
All of this is so drastically out of character for my FIL, that I believe they filed this out of spite to inconvenience him, or maybe even as a means to another end.  
He had to evict them because they stopped paying rent and strung him along with promises of payment and the occasional payment of less than 10% of what they owed. He tried to work with them for about 6 months before he filed for eviction.  
They rented two small commercial offices in a small town building. They contested the eviction, but then settled for being granted a few more weeks and in turn agreed to a payment plan, which afaik they have not honored.  
When they finally moved out, the places weren't in great shape, but there was nothing obviously malicious.  
However, they did claim at that time already towards a deputy, that he had been harassing them by tearing apart their shop sign and screaming at them. I do not believe for a second that he would scream at any person ever, and he probably did not tear apart their sign, because he could produce it intact immediately. But, he had gone there and taken it down when he posted a for-rent sign.  
When they found new places, the owners called him for a reference. He is fairly active in the community, and many people know him. He did describe exactly what happened to the owners, and it is fairly likely that they lost their not yet signed lease because of that call.  
Now, the restraining order is actually a problem, because it appears that the woman has found a new place within 500ft of his property. So when he goes in to show it, he would be violating the restraining order, if I understand everything correctly. I could also imagine that they're trying to somehow trick him into violating it, just out of revenge, or maybe even to establish a pattern for yet another frivolous suit later. I have personally not met them or witnessed anything, but again, everything they described in the restraining order does not fit at all to his character.

After they turned the cops flip their lights on and they come to the vehicle, make everyone roll down their windows and take their id's and proceed to detain them and then go on to search the car, find a bag of weed in one friends bag as well as  a bong, lighter, etc and the other one who had no weed only a scale and possibly lighters/rolling papers.

It's my senior year. My school is trying to make me get on a mandatory meal plan. They changed to a new provider with a new requirement that all students purchase it (it makes the school money). I already lived off campus so I could cook my food and because of my mental health am not always able to go to a huge dining hall with hundreds of other people every single time I want to eat. I would just eat at home but I can't both pay for the plan and buy food. 

I have anxiety and depression as diagnosed by a medical professional. The school knows this and has known it for three years because they give me accommodations.

When I spoke with a woman in the accessibility office (who has not answered any of my questions in a timely or complete manner), she told me there is no longer a medical meal plan option and that students who used to have one would have to work with the dining company in the first week of school to work out a good solution. I know for a fact that since my refusal is rooted in a health issue this could be breaking HIPAA among other things (please let me know). It smells really illegal and discriminatory. 

Does the Americans with disabilities act make it illegal to force me to go to the dining hall? Title 9? What legal language should I use? Interested in any and all suggestions.

One girl said the school wouldn't help her until she used the words ""eating disorder"" so I'm thinking about trying that. But I still have a diagnosed mental illness and can get a medical professional to request accommodations accordingly, so it still feels like they should not be able to sweep me under the rug legally even though my illness' connection to food might fall in a grey area according to some people.

I made friends with a fellow nursing student about a year ago. We got along well for a most of that time until she started acting very strangely so I tried to reduce our interactions to more of an acquaintance level. I still helped her with school work and coached her through some NCLEX practice exams. I made sure to be very non-confrontational as she has mentioned all sorts of mental instability issues in the past and how she hates having any sort of direct confrontation. I have no idea if any claims about depression or anxiety are actually diagnosed.

We ended up with pretty much the SAME EXACT schedule this past semester. So naturally, we would walk to class together and occasionally go to the restroom together. Normal female things. Nothing she did gave me any cause for alarm. I never tried to bother her. I thought it was a simple, functional, school-based friendship.

This is where things get strange. She started acting very distant and would ignore about half the time when I would say hi and she started leaving class for long periods. Then she started leaving whenever I would even be in the same hall way. She'd leave class about a minute before it was over and not make eye contact with anyone. I thought maybe she was having a serious problem so I texted her to see if she was okay. If anything was wrong, etc. If I could help. I may not want to be best friends but when someone acts THAT oddly, maybe just a little compassion can change whatever situation they are in.

She assures me that everything is fine and then started ignoring me completely a few days later. I gave up on trying to figure out what was up or if I could help. I kept to myself. This was a while back.

I get a text about a week ago saying that she feels uncomfortable with how much I stalked her last semester and she didn't think it was okay for me to go to the restroom with her because she felt that I wanted an intimate relationship and would try something.

I told her I was uncomfortable with further contact after telling her it had been a while since I 'stalked' her and that the stalking she was talking about was unavoidable on both of our parts because we had five classes together in the same day. If she was following me or I her, it couldn't have been avoided but that whatever she perceived to be the case was simply us walking to class together. She was the one that showed up on campus on days that she had no classes and went to some of my classes with me (I had seven classes total that semester). I feel like if anyone should be scared of the situation, it should be me. I'm not, though. Just uncomfortable.

I'm worried that since this contact was so out of the blue and so unprovoked with specific details on how I made her feel threatened basically, that she's trying to set me up in some way. I'm genuinely worried because what if she's saying all of that and being so unpredictable because she's about to do something like file a restraining order? That would kill any future I could have as a nurse.

We are both early thirties in Nebraska if that affects regional laws.

What should I do? Save the texts and get a lawyer on retainer just in case? I don't understand why she would just now start doing all of this when we haven't really talked since last semester. This whole situation feels very wrong to me. I know she's a very good manipulator which is one of the main reasons I stopped associating with her so much. This all just feels too odd and specific to mean anything good.

5b60e59fda52255c20d08150,"My girlfriend's brother hit somebody for making lewd comments about my girlfriend, who is under 18. He's facing charges. What does he do? (Colorado). I realize that this is probably a lost cause, but whatever.

For context, my girlfriends brother, called Eric for this story, works in a family-owned restaurant in a mountain town in Colorado. My GF, called Jane for this story, was going to the town to meet up with her brother, as they hardly ever see each other. He is 27, Jane is 17. Eric has been working in a restaurant to finance his wedding to his fiancé, Jordan (fake name). He also works in ski patrol during the winter and does odd jobs around the town during the summer.

The incident began when Jane arrived in town. Jane and Jordan were waiting outside the restaurant for Eric to get off his shift, and both of them go inside to ask Eric how long he has remaining in his shift before he's off. Jane goes to wait outside while Jordan talks to the manager. Jordan comes back outside, apparently looking really creeped out and distraught. Jane asks what happened, Jordan says the manager asked how old Jane was, saying ""what is she? 19? 20?"" Jordan relies and says, ""no, she's 17, why?""

The manager responds with ""well when she's wearing shorts like that she might as well be 20. She's got an ass like a 20 year old"" and then made a gesture where he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and inserted his other index finger into the hole repeatedly. (This is obviously a sex gesture).

It should be noted here that the manager of the restaurant is not the owner, and is a 42 year old man. 

Jane and Jordan wait for Eric to get off work, and when he does, they tell him of the situation. Eric replies with ""I'm going to fucking beat his ass."" (Eric is very protective of Jane. For the first 6 months of our relationship, our dates were always me and Jane… and Eric. Were like brother now though.) 

Jane and Jordan tried to hold him back from going into the restaurant, but they're small girls while Eric is 6'4"" 250 lbs of pure muscle. He walked back into the restaurant, and Jane and Jordan followed him. He asked the manager what he said about his sister, and he, strangely, told Eric exactly what he said, with gesture and all, and added at the end ""she's a dirty little girl, isn't she Eric?"" And winked after the last question.

Eric uppercutted the manager so hard he left the floor briefly before hitting the ground. The manger was driven to the hospital by Eric, and has a concussion, a broken cheekbone, and brief amnesia.

I should say now that this is all 2nd hand. I didn't witness any of this, but Jane and Jordan saw all of it and relayed it to me.

5b60e59fda52255c20d08341,"GF purchased car from my dad [NJ], my dad never transferred title or registration, been 2 years and still hasn't done anything, we moved to CA. What to do?. Long time lurker, first time poster, so please excuse any formatting mistakes or anything.

Basically, back in June 2015, my dad was tight on money, so to help him out, my gf and I decided to purchase his 2011 Nissan Murano off of him. She got an auto loan to pay the car for approx $15,000. This mean my gf would have a total of two cars, an Infiniti Sedan, and now a Nissan Murano SUV. Every time we approached him to sign over the title and registration, he claimed he was too busy and stuff (we opened a restaurant together). On our off days, he was always wanting to stay home and do his own thing instead of just signing it over, and he would sometimes get mad when we bugged him about it. This all happened in NJ. We currently posses the only copy of the title, but it is in my dad's name.

Fast forward to about Feb 2017, we got into a series or arguments that basically ended in me and gf moving from NJ to CA. As stated before, the 3 of us (Gf, myself, and dad) opened a moderately successful restaurant in NJ, but the my dad was essentially emotionally abusing us throughout the course of the restaurant (calling us worthless/names constantly, yelling at us all the time, throwing things near us to scare us). We could no longer deal with it, so we packed our bags and moved to CA, and took the Infiniti as the car to road trip in. We finally got to CA in April 2017, and we realized we still haven't gotten the title or registration transferred to my gf's name. We are still paying the auto loan for the Nissan (loan under her name), and the Nissan Murano is still with my dad back in NJ. We obviously live in CA now, so we can't just take the car, and we would prefer not to speak to him, but will do so if it benefits us financially.

I sent him an email about a month ago telling him he needs to transfer the title and registration to her name, or he needs to take over the loan payment. He did not respond. 

Right now, as it stands, these are the issues:

1.) We are paying for a car that we do not possess (we are in CA and the car is in NJ).

2.) Dad is currently using our car for his own work/personal use (He is in NJ using the car).

3.) We are paying for the auto loan that is under our name. We took out that auto loan to purchase the Nissan Murano from my dad.

The possible solutions that I would like to happen would be:

1.) We are able to bring the car to CA, and preferably sell it just to pay off the auto loan

OR

2.) He takes over the loan payment.

I am not too comfortable on letting him take over the loan payment as he has abused his power in the past, and he is the type of individual to not pay the loan just to ruin my gf's credit.

OTHER INFORMATION:

He currently owns the restaurant that me, my gf, and him worked on together (he financed, we put in sweat equity, no pay for 1.5 years, but that's another issue). He definitely has the money to either purchase the car back OR purchase another car of his own. We just do not want to be stuck with a payment for a car that we do not have. When we finally get the car, we would most likely sell it to pay back the loan.

My questions to the readers are:

1.) What would be the best route to obtain the registration?

2.) How would we transfer the name of the title and registration to my gf's name?

3.) How would we get possession of the car?

4.) Is there anyway to punish my dad for his actions? Will there be any punishment on our end for being unable to transfer the title and registration to our names?

I am a current customer of Sprint. I set up my account with them on May 14,2017. This would make my billing due date the 14th of each month. I enrolled in the auto-pay to receive a discount on my bill as well, and was told that my bill would be $175.81 a month. 

However, I noticed that this date would not work for me, it didn't coincidence with my pay dates from my employer. So I called to see about having my billing due date changed to make sure that each month I would have the funds in my checking account to accommodate the bill, at which point the person I talked to said ""Sure no problem"", never having mention that by doing this it would cause me to be doubled billed the next month.   

When I looked at my account and found out about being double billed, I called to inquire about the double charges and was told that was policy whenever you request a change in the billing due date. They credited my account $20.00 for my inconvenience, whatever. I was pissed but ok, I accepted that.
 
Today, on July 15th, I received a text message from Sprint saying that they tried two times to retrieve my payment!  What the Hell! Its only the 15th why are they attempting to take the payment now? I didn't have the $231.36 in my account, so I called to tell them that each time they try to collect the payment (that isn't even due for four more days), they caused my account to be charged $25.00 in NSF fees, making it a total of $50.00 worth of NSF fees (so far).
 
I called to have them explain to me why they have done this and to request that they put back the $50.00, because my account is now overdrawn, only to be transferred to 10 different people, and was treated like I was dumb and told that there isn't anything they can do to help me. Two different people said that they would stay on top of this, that it would be back into my account by the end of the day today was told to hang on while they put in the final notes to assure me that it would be resolved, only to be transferred to another person who doesn't know what is going on. At this point I just want my money back, but all I got was ""Take a deep breath"" and ""calm down"" and ""we can not assist you"". What am I supposed to do now?

We were told by her that the kitten was 9 weeks old and was litter trained. She also wrote that she would pay us around $20 a week to watch him. When she brought over the kitten, he was obviously to small to be 9 weeks and he hadn't had any of his shots. Later we found out he wasn't litter trained. Since he is so small he requires a lot of attention and we both think that he is more around 3-5 weeks old.  

We contacted her about making appointments for the kitten to receive his shots and to be dewormed, along with requesting she bring kitten food instead of the cat food she ended up bringing. Soon it was obvious that she probably just wanted to dump the kitten on someone, we asked her to come pick up the kitten. She then messaged back that he was our problem now and she was not responsible for him, and if he was that much of an issue we should put the kitten down. She then blocked us.

Are any legal options we could go about returning the kitten or even reporting the owner? Is she required to pay us the money she told us she would? We have all the text messages about the kitten.

5b60e59fda52255c20d086f4,"Question about selling of home in LLC while potential of separation/divorce looms in NYC. Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I need help in a big way. It's a complicated story between me and my wife and children, but, I'm trying my hardest to remain in the relationship and I got us into counseling because I want to save the marriage. But I am not sure if I can deal with the abuse (pretty severe emotional abuse I believe is from a depression from past experiences) and so therefore I want to ask this question as a means of protecting myself should the worst happen. I put that out there as the background but don't want to get too into personal details about it and detract from the real question, which is how to sell a home I recently inherited but keep it separate from our joint marital assets in NYC.

I became 25% owner of a two family house, within an LLC, about 10 years ago in NYS, and became full owner after my mother died in 2017. I am now sole owner of the LLC and there is nothing else within the LLC outside of this 2 family home. I am interested in selling this this home within the next few months because it is a lot of work to maintain it, I have zero experience in home ownership and the place needs repairs, and each month it costs money which we don't have. I could manage to hold onto it and rent out both units, but really my wife wants to move into a better school zone for our children. Given all this, we are both interested in selling in the next 6 months. it's taken too much time and money from us.

My wife and I are going through hard times and I am not sure if we will stay together. I hope we do but I want to protect myself. As I understand it, since the property and LLC came to me through inheritance, it is not part of the marital assets that gets divided with my wife should we divorce. However, if I do sell it I believe it can become co-mingled and become part of the martial assets that can be divided with my wife. I don't want it to be co-mingled and I would like to figure out what to do to keep this separated from our joint martial assets. Are people here familiar with this at all? What is the best way to structure the sale so that it remains with me and separate from the martial assets should we divorce? I heard that if I sell it I can keep the money from the sale in a separate bank account, not co-mingled in a joint account, as a way of keeping it separate, but I am not sure if this is true. Someone mentioned something about a trust to me but I had no idea what that meant and if they were accurate.

To keep things simple, my family and I bought a house in Québec back in May with a closing date of this coming week. We saw the house, loved it, put the offer in with the only inclusions being the air conditioners, dish washer, clothes washer and dryer, and a the hot tub. We went back to Ontario and sold our house and begun the process. The house we bought was listed with a For Sale by Owner type company, the sellers are contractors who build houses and sell them, and built this house to live in, and now sold it to build something new.

We went to 'see' the house today, which was just to drop off our moving truck until Wednesday closing. The house looks like a foreclosure. The grass hasn't been cut in weeks, the entire front of the house is covered in tall weeds and plans, almost obstructing the view from down the street. The backyard is also filled with weeds, un-kept, and the hot sub is almost engulfed in plant-life. 

They've also left a children's play set (large wooden thing), large construction tires (I guess as play toys for their kids), a large metal swing, broken wooden shipping pallets, and other garbage around the exterior of the house. The interior looks terrible also, but I give them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they moved the furniture today and will be going back to clean the inside before Wednesday.

We emailed the seller to say we are want the exterior garbage removed, and to state our displeasure with the current abandoned look of the property. Our problem is this, Notaries deal with houses in Québec and don't work on behalf of the buyer (us), so what do we do when Wednesday comes along and the house looks like a bank foreclosure and the cost to remove the trash and re-landscape could cost over $10,000? We've been living in a hotel for a week, all of our belongings are either in a truck or our hotel room.

 After working for less than 15 minutes. I was immediately approached by my manager, and asked to step outside with him to have a conversation. 

He immediately accused me of being intoxicated, stating that I had been slurring my words. He had not heard anything out of the ordinary, but an un-named source had reported the ""slurring"" to him. He stated the I did not smell of alcohol, nor did I appear drunk, but he was, ""worried something was going on."" 

  After speaking with him for about 15 minutes, pointing out that I have never had any alcohol on the job (before or during), did not smell of alcohol, and was clearly not drunk. He appeared to agree with me. Moments later, he asked thay I clock out (depriving me of a shift that I desperately need) and leave immediately. Additionally, he mentioned that he would ""let everyone know know that I was simply being sent home because I was ""sick"", as the staff had all already been told I was ""drunk"". 

I relieve there may well be no legal recourse here, thought this feels very much like classic defamation, especially considering all of my co-workers were well aware of my manufactured drunkenness. 

If there is nothing I can do, then so be it. I guess I will just be the guy who shows up to work drunk, except I don't, and never would.

Hello, I am a 23 year old male with no past criminal or any legal history. I was camping with friends in Acadia National Park in the state of Maine and we bone-headedly didn't realize that the land inside the park is federal and not part of Maine. We were caught with a small amount of weed and given US District Court Violation Notice that charges me with 36 CFR 2.35 (b) (2), ""possession of a controlled substance marijuana.""

5b60e5a1da52255c20d09afe,"Being sued in small claims in another state over vacation rental chargeback. I live in Ohio and last year used a vacation rental site to book a few days at a house in Mexico. A few days before my trip, the property owner called to say there may be some work happening at the home I rented and that he'd need to put me up at a much larger home nearby. The house was larger but most of the amenities were non-existent or non-functional - including locks on the exterior doors.

When I arrived back, I spoke with the vacation rental site and they said to file a dispute through my credit card as I had been subject to a ""bait and switch"". I did so and the credit card company quickly refunded my money.

Today I was served with a summons to appear in a small claims court in San Francisco - apparently where the owner of the property lives. I've never been to San Francisco and the rental was in Mexico. The claim says that I falsified receipts with the credit card company in order to win my dispute.

A little bit of sleuthing leads me to believe that I can write a letter to the court explaining that because I don't live in the county (or the state for that matter) that they'll be able to just drop the case. **Should I write a letter explaining why the venue is wrong?**


I didn't provide any receipts at all to the credit card company. I simply explained what I experienced and they said I was right to dispute and that the merchant didn't respond to their inquiry with him so they took the money back. **Is there anything else I should be doing?**

5b60e5a1da52255c20d09b74,"[MD] A vehicle titling cluster****. I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...

tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.

Full story:
I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail). 

The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.

I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.

A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.

I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.

So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.

So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily.",0.75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75,,,,,

I wouldn't think of going around to the back of someone's property let alone entering their lanai.

5b60e5a1da52255c20d09c35,"Program manager fired me after I went over his head with problems. Now an investigator wants to talk to me (TX). I worked for a 501c3 as an at-will grunt for three years. I reported some mistreatment of my coworkers (bullying, intimidation) and strong indications my Manager was lying about our numbers to the state (we're grant-funded) to our CFO. This was six months ago. I was told to come to her with any problems after our previous supervisor left, but according to our handbook CFO is not a protected whistleblower resource.

Shortly after, Manager let me know in no uncertain terms that nothing was changing. I realize that the CFO simply told supervisor exactly what was said. My coworker and I began to be subjected to constant site visits, which disrupt the traffic in our type of work. Questioning the supervisor on any subject became grounds for faux-disciplinary meetings, and we began getting write-ups for missed deadlines that weren't enforced in any other department. We were threatened with preparatory audits of our finances and paperwork (this has never been done, there has never been a problem, they take an enormous amount of time, and the actual audit is years away) and scheduled so that we worked large amounts of unpaid overtime, which we were told we could not bill for at the start of our employment. This stuff made our working lives miserable for months for virtually zero gain. It seems like this qualifies as retaliation, but aside from outbursts at meetings I recorded most of it just looks like unnecessarily strict oversight.

I decided to try my luck with HR, in the middle of this (three months ago), which the handbook did list as a protected whistleblower resource. They listened to me and two coworkers, and said ""these things take time, we're going to have to go to the board."" Shortly afterward, one of the coworkers that went to HR was fired, and a couple of miserable months afterward I was also fired for missing a deadline for internal docs by a day.

At this point all of my remaining coworkers were even more miserable, and my former supervisor appeared completely untouchable, and our project was suffering for it, so I threw a hail mary and sent a letter to the president of our organization's board (a lawyer). He met with me and said he'd probably hire an employment lawyer to look into it. Neither he nor the board had heard anything about complaints from me or anybody else from HR, which I believe, given that he didn't seem to know Manager by name or anything about our program.

Now I find out at least one of the things I reported on behalf of a coworker to PotB has been investigated and the person involved suspended, and I got a call from our CEO saying ""We take this very seriously, and we'd like you to talk to an employment lawyer we've hired to investigate the other concerns."" 

All I have personally are emails documenting when I met with CFO and HR (which also outlined the complaints), some recordings of Supervisor being inappropriately and strangely aggressive in meetings, and my narrative of what happened. The five other employees who still work in my old department are also extremely unhappy, but aside from one person's emails to Supervisor outlining their bullying and other unprofessional behavior, it basically adds up to six peoples' combined hundreds of work stories about Manager being an enormous fucker and complaints to HR getting immediately redirected back to Manager.

Is any of the stuff I've already talked about a red flag for employment lawyers? Will they consider Manager as a legal liability if it adds up to heaps of borderline-actionable material, or only if they find something damaging off the bat? How should I present this to waste as little of their time as possible?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75
5b60e5a1da52255c20d09c9f,"[CO] Management falsely editing employees time punches to reflect ""compony policy"". Hello all,

I am in a predicament right now regarding my current employer. I recently became a member of the management team at a new local restaurant. My company currently has six restaurants under its belt, and we opened this new restaurant for business last year and I've worked there since. My co-supervisor was recently trained on how to complete payroll before payday rolled around. In passing she candidly said:
&gt;I have so much work to do! I have to go through everyone's time punches and edit them to be at least 5 minutes before their shift.

Our company policy essentially states that all employee's punches that are earlier than 5 minutes before a scheduled shift time will be edited to be, at most, 5 minutes before that shift. 

That night I talked to one of our company's longer tenured managers and asked him about this practice. He told me that its ""company policy"" and everyone agreed to these policies when they signed their contracts. Many of the managers at other restaurants seem complacent about this practice. I know that you can't just write whatever you want in a contract and call it a day so I was thinking this may be an unenforceable.

I did some light research on the topic on the DOL's website and, from my understanding of the law, the law states that an employer may only edit time punches if an employee incorrectly recorded time (i.e forgetting to clock in or out). But they may not edit time punches in order to reflect something like a ""company policy.""

Now I'm not losing any sleep from my punch being edited from 2:54pm to 2:55pm. I am, however, concerned that my company is simply operating unethically. I want to talk to my HR representative and understand more about where this policy is coming from. But I also feel a little slimy doing payroll and having to edit these punches. Long term I am not interested in going to court about lose wages, etc. I just want my company to operate ethically and fairly.

So, my questions:
1) Is this legal at all?
2) Is this employment contract ""unenforceable"" because of this verbiage?
3) Is there anything a lowly supervisor can do about this company-wide practice?

Holding rental property with out deposit or signed lease or any money what so ever.

The wife of the couple 23f and 23 m military put me on the spot several times. 


Things I've tried to graciously provide but is turning and in fact turned into a nitpicking negotiating, bulldozing nightmare.

""Reduce the pet fee since one pet is emotional therapy but will not prove it""

""Let us paint (before even seeing the house it's recently been professionally painted for 2k)""

""Let us meet you in the middle of the night, give us directions for an hour, invite all our friends and bang on the door,oh we forgot the money, we didn't bring the signed lease, we couldn't find a printer, we don't want to sign the lease until we pay and didn't want to pay until we found out your a real person not a craigslist killer""

Everything screams (I'm an idiot me the op and they are entitled)

They've been in the house since 1am Saturday, can't get them to answer to meet up for the lease and payment, they promised they would but like everything else they just end up doing what they want.

When I called this evening they finally answered and instead of giving me a time to meet they say ""we don't wanna pay the full month and want you to take off money from the deposit we have a list of discrepancies, and instead of 865 we want to pay 500""

I explained I already did the walk through with them every appliance is new, we did not provide a washer and had warned them that, now that is a bargaining chip for them.

I saw the writing on the wall and said 
""You've not paid any money you've not signed a lease and you've not stopped making demands-it's clear I'm not going to make you happy this isn't working""

He says ""I need a week"" but also cusses me out and threatens me that they haven't signed anything so he doesn't have to do ""jack S----""

I say ""please no hard feelings but this will never work you've not jumped through any of the hoops that tenants are supposed to and I've had to do every single thing what your asking me to do now is too much special treatment""

The house could pass a military inspection it was spotless ontop and behind appliances professionally cleaned. 

They are not in the same reality... I know really shouldn't have let them move their stuff in but they were ""please don't make us get a storage unit tonight just for one night"" and he is a marine who just got back the beginning of the month, I didn't know things would get so out of hand but they kept pushing.

I ended the conversation by saying I might be able to give you 48 hour but I need you guys out because I really did hold the house for you and this has gotten out of hand, your not wanting to pay and your taking advantage of me (my stupidity in reality).

What do I do?
I need to know my rights, I am getting a property manager but I would like to get them out since they have no intention of really paying and keep stalling.

Being that neither of us currently has a job (I just graduated from college, and my brother has mostly been doing freelance-type work), the prospective landlord asked us to get our parents to sign a letter indicating that they would be paying our rent until we find jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

While our parents have agreed to pay the first month's rent plus the deposit, they are not willing to sign the letter and become our guarantors. Since I have a substantial amount in savings (more than enough for 2 years of the full rent, so over 4 years of my half of the rent), I asked if I could show him a bank statement in place of getting a signature from our parents. He said that was fine, and to just give it to him along with the rental application he asked us to fill out.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm wondering what steps I should take, if any, to protect myself, legally speaking. **I printed out my statement showing my name, address, account numbers (checking and savings), and balances. Is there any of this information that I should black out so that he can't see?** Also, I have only printed out the first page showing the most recent month's account balances, not the actual transaction history - not sure what exactly I should/shouldn't give him. I really, realllllly don't expect him to use this information in a malicious way (he is a 72-year old man with a flip phone, after all), but I was just wondering if it is possible that someone could piece together enough information from a bank statement  and potentially take my money/identity/whatever. I just can't think of any other way to get him to agree to rent to us. We need to move in the next month, and the rent is significantly cheaper than similar houses in the area, so we really do want this specific house. Plus, I'm not sure that anyone who didn't already know us would be willing to rent to us given our lack of employment history.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75,,,,,,,

I told my PO I was having problems with the conditions and I got a notice from the judge that I had a probation violation hearing ordered. I didn't start my community service until after the hearing was ordered and didn't finish it until after my probation was scheduled to end. I didn't enroll in a DUI school until afterwards too, and while I've now done that - they didn't have an opening until after the date of the hearing. Also they said I didn't do the vehicle immobilization, but I have paperwork saying I sold the car almost immediately (which I told them before).

I was sentenced to a year probation and was told to get an alcohol assessment and I am required to follow the recommendations from the alcohol assessment. Below is my story.




Jan 26 2017 I had an appointment with a lady named Katie at dawn farms for my alcohol assessment. I was court ordered to have an alcohol assessment. During the assessment, Katie recommended that I do 24 weeks of outpatient group therapy at dawn farms with a lady named Hannah on wednesdays from 2-3:30. Katie was training a young lady and explained the rules and asked if I had any questions regarding the assessment. She asked me to sign a piece of paper confirming everything that we went over and that I was to attend 24 weeks of outpatient meetings as well as attend 2 aa meetings per week.  I attended the 24 weeks with no issue. After the first 12 weeks, I didn't get a review over my performance or acknowledged on how I did. I was just given a piece of paper that I had to write new goals on and that was it. After completing the 24 weeks on July 12th 2017, Hannah mentioned to me that I could either continue to do the Wednesday's 2pm groups or switch to Thursday's.  There was never a discussion I had with anyone from Dawn Farms regarding another 12 weeks. The program has two phases, recovery group support and recovery support. One is 24 weeks and the other is 12. Not everyone does 36 weeks, or 24 weeks. Some people do 12 weeks but everyone signs the same form that states that in order to complete the Dawn farms program, you have to do 36 weeks. There are check marks next to both phases that you are recommended to do. My contract had the recovery support phase checked off and had it wrote by Katie in pen ""2 sets of 12=24 weeks"". I was not court ordered to complete the program, I was court ordered to get an assessment and to attend the recommended meetings that were given to me during the assessment. Every individual is different went it comes to the assessment. Katie might recommend something completely different than what another person might recommend, but she did my intake and no one else did. And since everyone is different, she assessed me based on the information I provided her and made the decision to give me 24 weeks of outpatient therapy. And That was her job but she no longer works there.

On July 14th I went to dawn farms at about 3:10 to speak with someone who could help me better understand why the piece of paper says something different than what was said to me from Hannah. A lady gave me a card and told me to speak to ray, who is the coordinator of the program.

I got ahold of ray at about 5pm and spoke with him about the issue. I explained to him the piece of paper and he said Katie may have screwed up with my intake. I told him that was not my fault, but we can't talk to her anyways because she no longer works there. Did she really screw up? These are done on an individual basis. He said that things may have changed from when I originally signed the paper in January. I told him that if that was the case then I was to sign a new form.  He told me that he wants to talk to his staff about this to make sure there are no loop holes like this again. This is not considered a loophole if this is something that they recommend to other people in treatment. This does not seem fair. Everyone who signs the same form would have to do 36 weeks. I was planning on signing up for classes at washtenaw community college. How am I suppose to plan things out for myself if there is a lack of communication and a lack of review after the 12 week period? He said that he would not write a letter saying that I completed the 36 weeks at dawn farms. I never asked him to write a letter to be dishonest and say that i did something I didn't do. I told him I want him to write a letter stating that I completed my 24 week recovery support group at dawn farm. I told him I would pick it up next week.



In terms of the dawn farms client handbook, it states that the staff will not lie to you or emotionally or physically abuse you. I feel like I was lied to and it's emotionally hurtful to know that I was mislead and it's causing me anxiety. I should feel good about being sober, not bad. I haven't had any screw ups since I've been at Dawn Farms.

After lots of conversations with GoDaddy support, I was finally able to access the account, pay for the registration for the next two years and transfer the account to my name. I did it this way because the company would literally not give me any info on whom I should set it up under and I was under a deadline to get the domain transfered. 

Question: Can I hold on to the domain as registered owner until if and when they pay me the low four figures they owe me? It's mostly to prove a point to them, not really profit.

5b60e5a1da52255c20d09dc3,"Offered a promotion, but it's less than what others make. (Corporate casino, non-union) help?. Hi Reddit. This is my first time posting on here, and any help would be much appreciated! I apologize for the sloppiness of the format, I'm typing this on my phone at work. 



I'm 26, Caucasian, female, and I work in the slot department on grave yard in a [non-union] casino. I've been in this department for 2 years, and the casino as a whole for almost 7 years. I recently, after much prodding and being insistent on other managers, have been offered a dual rate ""promotion.""  By becoming a dual rate, im basically a mini supervisor. My current rate is $10.90 an hour. The promotion is $1. But it doesn't entirely bump my pay up. Days that I supervisors all day (which would possibility be once every two weeks) I would make $11.90/hour for 8 hours. Days that I don't supervise the entire day, I would get paid $11.90 for 2 hours. 

The major problem is that the manager who had the final say in promoting me told me I would be getting $2 more. All of the other dual rates make $2 more per hour. So essentially $16 more when they supervise all day, and $4 a day when they don't. Said manager (I think his official title is assistant casino operations manager, or some other fancy mumbo jumbo,) played a ton of games when it came time to offering me this promotion because he didn't want to do it since it takes away from his bonus. For example, he told another manager to tell me it was okay to promote me, even though HE was the one who had the final say so. He also took his sweet time going to HR to get the paperwork going.  This manager is also trying to cut expenses in any way possible so he gets a bigger bonus. Gotta love corporate. 

The two dual rates on my shift make $2 more for supervising. Technically for them it's only $1.85 more because they got a $0.15 raise about a year or so ago. I am the lowest paid person on my shift. Everyone is at $15 an hour or more. Part of the reason is that they have been here since day one and were on a different pay scale. (Different ownership, Michael Gaughan at first and then Boyd gaming.). I understand being considerably newer, I won't be making as much as somebody since day one. My raises are $0.20 a year. That is part of the reason I wanted to become a dual rate at that $2 mark. I would basically be getting a $0.50 cent raise. My biggest gripe is that other dual rates make $2 more, why are they trying to get me to take $1?  Even newer dual rates got it at $2 an hour.

One of the managers on my shift says he personally thinks they're trying to get one over on me and suggested I sit down and talk with the director and assistant manager. After doing some thinking and talking to my best friend, I don't think meeting with them is a bad idea and inquiring about why my pay is considerably lower, especially given the fact the assistant manager TOLD ME $2 more.  I don't have any concrete proof that he told me, so it's my word versus his. I figured having the director and assistant manager in there wouldn't be a bad idea because that way it won't turn into a big game of he said she said. 

I figured with the meeting, I would thank them for giving me this opportunity to further my career, but I was under the impression the promotion would be more. I know I can't be aggressive, but I can't be passive either. It's easier said than done. I don't know if they're going to care it'll literally take 20 years to get to where everybody else is at. Depending on where this meeting goes will determine what the next step is. Part of me is nervous that they'll take away my promotion for questioning them... then it opens up a discriminatory / retaliation case.  But I don't feel right taking the promotion knowing it should be more money. 

One of the things I did look up was the NLRA section 7 which basically says employees are allowed to discuss salaries amongst themselves. So during my meeting if they tell me that I'm not allowed to talk about it, I can let them know there's a federal law which protects me, and section 8 of the act basically says they can't retaliate against me for inquiring about other people's pay.

I don't really want to get another job. I live in Las Vegas, and the economy is tough. Not to mention, it took me 2 years to get full time in my department. I don't want to give that up just to have to do it somewhere else and possibility wait longer than that to become full time. I do really like my job for the most part. Working on graveyard is awesome. The people on this shift are cool and want me to better myself. Also, I make tips. A lot of nights were slow, but I make good money for working a shift that isn't too busy. 

The casino I work at is not union, so I'm only protected by federal laws. I would like some thoughts and opinions on the matter. Should I fight it? Should I shut up and take the dollar? Am I being a brat? Are there any other laws that protect me, or let upper management do whatever they want? Do I even stand a chance?

5b60e5a1da52255c20d09e0b,"Lawyer is MIA, debt collectors are calling. I apologize in advance for totally butchering this but I really don't know the lingo.

February 2016 I was in a car accident (we were rear-ended). I opted to get checked out when EMS came by, they drove me to a nearby hospital, no big deal just some prescribed painkillers for the neck/back pain and headache.  Turns out the car that hit us was a professional driving service, currently on the job driving a couple to some event. It also turned out that the father of the driver of the car I was in was a lawyer. He drove to meet us at the hospital.

He offers to represent us and sue the company. I say that sounds alright, so I signed something saying he would be representing me in that civil suit, and he would only charge a percent of whatever the outcome is. He starts badgering me over the next 2-3 months or so to get physical therapy and send him the bills. I know he's just looking to blow up the damages he's seeking in the suit, but I'm feeling okay enough and I really didn't have insurance or the money to drop on the therapy when I didn't know what would happen with the suit.

So debt collecting agencies start calling me from both the EMS that drove me to the hospital and the hospital charging me for the check up. This goes on for a few months before I say ""I have a lawyer working on this case seeking damages from the company that rear-ended us"" and they just ask for his info and that's it. Haven't heard from the agencies since January 2017.

So back to my lawyer, he's totally MIA. I have not heard a word from him about the case. Is it normal for this to take almost a year and a half? I signed a contract with the guy, but I don't have a copy. Is there any way I can demand something out of this? I really need some updates especially since I don't know what's up with the debt collectors and when they'll be back. Also, is it possible that it's just too late now to pursue a civil suit? The accident was in February 2016.

For more context, the accident happened in the Bethesda, Maryland area. I'm a college student in DC, but my permanent residence is in Florida. I gave the hospital and EMS my DC address, so that's where I've been receiving the letters from them but I'm moving next month. Also, I haven't checked my credit reports, but I use CapitalOne's CreditWise credit tracker and the debts haven't been reported, is this normal too?

TL;DR I signed a contract with a lawyer to pursue a case against a professional driving services company for rear-ending me. I haven't heard from the lawyer in months. Debt collectors hounded me until I told them I had a lawyer working on pursuing damages from the company. I want this case to move forward. What should I do?",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,,0.75,,,,,

5b60e5a1da52255c20d09e7e,"Legal recourse for vehicle insurance fraud. So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started. 
Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.

I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month. 

I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.

I recently decided to make the jump onto the Oculus Rift + Touch bundle for €450 from Oculus directly, tried it for a few days, and decided it's not for me.

I set out to get a refund from Oculus, and noticed that

&gt; As per Section 4.4 of our Terms of Service, located [here](https://www.oculus.com/legal/terms-of-service/), we do not provide refunds for opened or used hardware products, so the Rift cannot be returned.

I decided to email them for a refund regardless, because as far as I know I have the rights to get a complete refund. That's when I got sent the above message.

When I told them the Oculus Touch box is still unopened, they replied

&gt; we can look further into what can be done about them.

I asked some friends for advice and we think we found the right law to call upon, and formatted an email for Oculus.

&gt;
&gt; Please provide a return shipping label by COB (insert date) for return of the goods. 
&gt;

Could you please enlighten me if what we've come up with is the correct procedure?

- I live in The Netherlands
- I bought the Oculus Rift + Touch Bundle from Oculus VR Ireland Limited through Paypal
- I received the product 6 days ago, on July 11th
- The Oculus Rift was used for a few days to test it
- Oculus Touch is still unopened in box

Finally the last major issue is a broken thermostat. The original thermostat in her apartment looked as though it was from the early 90s. A mercury one I think. It was broken throughout the year and it took until this past month for them to replace it.

Of course, they've put in work orders over these issues. She's has the ability to look at the work order history for her unit, but it appears either the apartment company's system changes the dates automatically or someone is changing them manually.

For the sake of keeping this somewhat private for now, we will say I do lawn maintenance although what I actually do is specific to the area I live and is in high demand. I started working for the company about a year ago. My boss (owner of the company) hired me to fill in for someone who had recently been fired, and him and I (as his helper) were the entire company. I started at $10/hr. As time progressed, i took on more responsibility and after about 4 or 5 months, started doing nearly 100% of the work by myself. My boss then hired a worker to be my helper, and began more of a role that consisted more of doing estimates and taking phone calls. He is not a super presentable guy, though he is very friendly, he's just kind of got this very country/hillbilly vibe about him. Ever since I started working with him, business has been growing substantially faster than it did in the previous 2 years of him owning the company. business is now stronger than ever, and i am being worked to the bone in the summer heat every day using and depending on equipment that is far beyond being in need of repair. It has gotten frustrating to be in charge of everything, (working my *** off), and maintaining to represent the company to the best of my ability, all while making $12/hour on jobs that bring company $2,000-$3000 profit every two days. 

This being said, I learned a few months ago that my boss had taken my social security number that he made a copy of when I first started working for him to make me an LLC, unannounced to me. This also included filing a ""workers compensation exemption form"" on my behalf for me. The worker who is my helper is also filed on that llc as my employer/subcontractor (not sure which)I do like my boss, and don't really mind the work if it was for more money, I just feel underpaid for the major role I play in the company. 

For the past few months I've been saving and working towards gathering all materials I need to begin doing jobs myself (trailer, about $2000 worth of equipment). I now have almost everything I need, and am only short of getting my own business liability insurance and business license to have everything complete. 

My question is, how would you approach the situation if you were in my position? I do like my boss and wouldn't mind continuing to subcontract for his company. However, I'm not sure how he will handle the news that I may become his competition. The way I see it- For the entire length of employment with this company, I have been miscatagorized as a subcontractor. I am now doing what is necisarry for me to actually be subcontracted by him (or another company in the same field.. 2 of which have offered to pay me more than double what my current boss does, but those two company's were both under the impression at the time that the equipment I had with me was all mine when it was actually my current bosses). An arrangement where I help to train my worker to fill my position while my own business picks up seems ideal to me, but am I being too hopeful thinking he would continue to employ me when he knows I'm going to give him competition on my own? I know he is going to feel betrayed and tell me it's a bad idea etc. I'm just trying to think of the best way to present it to him so that the process that both he and I will soon undergo is relatively seamless. I feel like we could both still help each other to an extent, I'm just not sure how to phrase it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,,,,,,,0.75

5b60e5a1da52255c20d09f5e,"Need Quick Advice Re: A Transient Going to Sentencing this Morning, Please!. For ease, I will describe what I understand to be true as fact. I'm happy to clarify anything that seems unlikely, my information comes from various sources including the subject. 

A transient (T) was falsely arrested a few months ago. She was already on probation for multiple minor charges (i.e. drunk in public), when she was shopping at a local store and had an altercation with an employee. The police were called, they looked for a reason to arrest her, and the store clerk said T spit on her. T is adamant that any spit that may have come out was accidental because she was talking loudly. 

After some time trying to meet probation requirements, T was eventually picked up for missing a court date and has been in jail awaiting trial for months. Her Public Defender was going to take it to trial because the DA wouldn't budge and wanted to throw the book at her, the PD thought that was dumb. For background: T is mentally ill, physically disabled, has cognitive impairments, TBI, has been living on the streets for a decade, in and out of jail for minor offenses and drugs but nothing serious. 

T has court this morning, and I found out late last week that it is for sentencing. I spoke to T (who is not always the most reliable source, but tends to be honest with me), and her PD convinced her to plea no contest, otherwise they were going to give her a year and a half because ""the judge doesn't want a trial."" Her PD also told her she'd seen surveillance video, which does *not* show the store clerk reacting as though she'd been spat on.

I'm concerned T doesn't understand that pleading no contest to something she was falsely arrested for means she won't be able to potentially recover damages from the false arrest (she had been trying really hard at that point and there had been some improvement, and she was *on her way to therapy* when this incident happened). I want to send an email to her PD before the sentencing to express my concerns that T isn't fully mentally competent and that she doesn't understand the implications here. I have about an hour.

Also, I know this kind of plea coercion is common, but I hope I don't sound too naive when I say I don't like it being used on a vulnerable member of the population. She has literally no resources in life, it was all too easy for a retail clerk to get annoyed that her authority wasn't respected and have this person incarcerated for months for it, and the police actively helped.

Ill start from the beginning to lay out all the facts. Thank you in advance for reading.

Feb '17 - I hit a large pothole in a construction zone on I-70, causing a sidewall bubble on my front right.

May '17 - I learn of ODOT claims, and filed a damage report. They defer me to the construction contractor who, for all intents and purposes, laughs at me. I am out +$100 for an alignment and now have a sidewall bubble.

July '17 - I hit another massive pothole on I-75 which blows my right front tire. I make it to a tire shop, and paid $618 for 2 new front tires and an alignment.

Today - I have filed another ODOT damage report, and attempted to file a claim but realized I was in over my head.

**I am looking for some advice on how to move forward. Here are my questions:**

What are my chances of repayment? This is the 2nd time in 2017 an ODOT liable interstate caused damage to my car.

What else can I do to accomplish repayment? Does this involve a claim?

Since my car did not need to be towed, and there was no police contact, there is little official documentation of the incident. Will they believe me?

I drive a performance car which has all wheel drive. This stipulates that all four tread depths must be similar. Now, my front 2 tires are new and my back two are 1 year old. I did not have the money to cover all 4 tires when replacing, so I did what I could. Since my car requires all four tires to have similar tread, is it reasonable to claim that the state pay for all four tires?

5b60e5a1da52255c20d0a04c,"Neighbors smoking (two types) is setting off the smoke alarm in my apartment. Texas. One of my neighbors (either the one directly behind me or the one directly above me) smokes a lot. It is annoying. You can smell it mostly in the bathrooms but it isn't unusual for it to permeate throughout the house. The bathroom also gets very smokey. Not like smell but obviously smokey. 

My son has a lung disorder and the smoke  often leaves him up at night coughing. It is frustrating. I usually go to my parents or to a hotel but the cost of the hotel will be prohibitive after a while and I'd like to stay in the apartment I rent since I pay for it.  

I've talked to management who says that although I specifically requested and got  a no smoking unit, that they made no promise that the adjacent units would be smoke free. 

The smoke at some points is enough to set off our smoke detectors nearest the guest bathroom. Usually when we are asleep. I complained to the apartment but their response was to send maintenance out to remove the smoke alarm which is near the bedroom and needs to remain there.  So I asked them to put it back up. The office manager suggested just removing the battery. It goes off a couple of times a week, usually after 10 when we are asleep when whoever starts chain smoking. Around that time, we either leave and go to my parents or we go to the opposite end of the apartment to sleep with the window open. 

One of the types of smoking they do is illegal in my state so I've reported them to the police who never come out. 

I have looked in my lease and there is no way to break it. 

I've tried to talk to the neighbor I think it is because he smokes and leaves dropping everywhere over the building (hallway, porches, etc) who basically told me to get lost and never knock on his door again. He dared me to call the police. Which I did but they again have not come out. 

Obviously, my son's health is more important than an apartment lease but I don't make enough money to really break it as they are saying I'll be responsible or the whole of the lease. We've only been there a month. 

I've had a doctor note that since moving into the apartment that my son's lung condition has worsened but he obviously doesn't give a concrete reason why. But he did mention that smoking could cause the condition to worsen. 

It does have a clause about excess noise and nuisance. Saying I have the right to quiet enjoyment of the apartment and the right not be harassed by neighbors. 

Would this be covered under the quiet enjoyment clause?

Also, if they re-rent the apartment they can't collect on the full amount of the least right? They can just collect on the months the unit is unre-rented right? 

So obviously I am moving out but I am trying to cut my loss a bit on the cost of breaking my lease. Medical bills are a huge expensive and I just can't afford to pay two leases at the moment. I've offered to negotiate and give them literally everything in my savings at the moment by paying 3 months of rent upfront if they just let me out of the lease. They declined saying as long as the apartment wasn't inhabitable then the full lease stood. They said they could take the full lease amount and let me move out. I don't have that.  

Can I do anything here? 

Right now, my son is staying with my parents temporarily but it just isn't logistically feasible for a long term solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.75,,,,,,,

5b60e5a1da52255c20d0a041,"Landlord wont let me bring my therapy pet next year. What are my options?. As a general rundown, I live in a college town where dogs are very rarely welcome due to students not taking care of their pets and not paying deposits. Unfortunately, this blocks good pet owners like myself from being able to keep their furry friends themselves. 

My therapy dog has been in my family for 8 years and came up to college with me as soon as I was able to bring her. This year, roommates and I agreed to move into a house for the next school year. Unfortunately, two of my roommates signed their part of the lease before I was able to read it over. When the landlord learned that I was planning on bringing my 5 pound poodle mix, he freaked out and would not let me sign my lease. He told the other two friends that they were stuck to a four bedroom house that they would have to split the rent between the two of them. After a week of pleading emails, he finally agreed to let me sign, so long as I signed a contract agreeing not to bring my dog or try to claim her as a therapy pet next year or I would be evicted. Normally I would be angry with people who sign at an apartment complex without planning anything for their dog, but I was in a bind where I had to help my roommates out and knew my family could take care of my dog if need be.

He says he has the title for the motorcycle, but that it's not in his name, it's still in the previous owner's name and that guy is dead.

A large US based retailer is not honoring the sale price for 2 suits that was advertised on their website. Just an fyi I am located in Canada and they operate here as well (online store and brick &amp; mortar stores).  I’ve spoken to three different reps before hand who assured me the price would be honored. They said I would get refunded the difference in about 1-2 weeks. It was close to 2 weeks after my purchase and I didn’t receive any refunds so I called back and they said they wouldn’t be able to honor the price anymore. I’ve complained countless times and management finally said they can honor both suits (They were very reluctant and made it difficult for me, they even closed my case without notice). 

Again about a month has passed and I still didn’t receive my full refund balance. Now after reaching out to management, they are saying they can only honor the one suit even after providing screenshots of the product listing with the sale price. 

Is this against the law? In Canada we have a law should cover this (http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00522.html#sale) and I believe this falls into this category. The sale price was still on the website 2 days after I made my purchase and they didn’t resolve the issue with me right away (I had to reach out to them to find out) and is still on going after more than 2 months. 

Secondly, I was charged a large amount of taxes and duties on the original price I paid but since I’m paying the sale price, shouldn’t I get refunded the difference in the duties/taxes fees? Again they are refusing to reimburse me for those fees that were charged.

5b60e5a1da52255c20d0a0ca,"We cannot work with co-founder anymore. If we continue working on the project separately, what will happen? (or how can we do it as pleasantly as possible). A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him. 

I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers. 

The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on. 

Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon. 

A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design. 

Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success. 

We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.

A provision in my lease states that I have to temporarily move out for the first week in April so that the homeowner can rent out the house for the Masters. This involves me moving all of my personal belongings, an endeavor that will be extremely time consuming. 

I had no issues with this provision when I signed  the lease because I believed that the rent / utilities for that month would be prorated to reflect my absence during Masters Week.

What if you get stranded?

A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.

Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.

It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.

So yesterday my father came home with a ""Brand new"" Samsung Galaxy Note 5 that he purchased at a local cellular and mobile phone service store.  While he was setting up his phone I noticed that the phone he had just bought did not come with the original Samsung box. Which seemed a bit strange to me since he claimed that the phone was brand new. I asked him if that was the box the phone came in with and why it was not the original samsung box. He was dumbfounded after I showed him that every brand new samsung phone comes in with a samsung box. (I showed him unboxing videos on youtube of the same phone) I then asked him how much he had paid for the phone and if he was given a receipt for his transaction.  He apparently paid $500 cash for the phone and was not even given a receipt. 

At this point the entire thing seemed pretty shady to me. But my dad dismissed my concerns and gave the store owner benefit of doubt and went to work. I decided to visit the store where he had purchased this phone and asked them why my father was not given the receipt for the phone that he had just bought. After pressing the matter I was provided with the receipt which my father had apparently ""Left behind."" But upon asking them why a ""Brand new phone"" was missing its original box I was kindly met with ""Get the fuck out of my shop."" and all of my requests for a potential refund were denied except for in store credit.
After looking at the receipt I found that it was missing any tax information and was showing an amount paid of $425 when my father paid $500 in cash.

When I got home I went through the contents of the box the phone came in with and found an amazon return slip. I believe that the store most likely bought a used phone on amazon and passed it off as brand new and sold it for $500 to my dad. I looked up  [Samsung Galaxy Note 5](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-N920A-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B013XB5L1A/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500305135&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=samsung+galaxy+note+5+unlocked) on amazon and a brand new one costs about $359 which I assume comes with the original box and it has free shipping. 

I really don't know how to proceed at this point. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 

p.s We live in Queens, NY.

TLDR; My father bought a brand new samsung phone for $500 which did not come with the original samsung box and the receipt provided by the store does not reflect the correct amount paid.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,,0.75,,,,,
5b60e5a1da52255c20d0a25d,"My mother collected life insurance from my fathers death. I was listed as the beneficiary.. My dad died (cancer) back in 2005.  He was divorced from my mother.  My two siblings and I lived with my dad full time.  When he died we went to live with my mother and her new husband.

Shortly after we moved in, they bought a new (not super nice) vehicle.  Then shortly after that a new (not super nice, but bigger) house.  Then another car.  They both worked road construction and made decent money, especially with the lower cost of living, so it didn't seem too strange to 15 year old me.  They just had three kids pushed into their lives, seems like a good reason to make some quality of life upgrades.

Fast forward to 2008/09 when I check the mail one day and see a letter addressed to me from a bank.  I open it to discover that not only do I have an account with them, but that it's overdrawn.  I show my mom the letter, she takes it and says that it's her account and she will handle it.  By this time I'm 17 or 18, so that did send a red flag, but I was still careless enough that I didn't bring it up again.

A couple of months later I get a letter from the IRS saying I owe them close to $15,000.  I don't think I had even earned up to that much in my life at that point.  I ask my mom what this is, she says she will take care of it.

I end up calling the IRS after a couple more letters, they say if I don't agree to a payment plan that they will garnish my wages.  I have no idea what they could be billing me for, so I ask them.  After a few more calls I learn that it's due to a life insurance payout totaling around $68,000.  I started thinking about all the cars and the house and the bank statement and put it together that my mother screwed me out of some life insurance money.  I confront her, she denies it.

Some fucked up shit happens over the next year or so.  My checks are being garnished, her husband  goes to prison, my mom goes through a couple of boyfriends, she tries to kill herself, one of the boyfriends splits with her truck.  And that's just the top of the iceberg.  I have buried so much of those years of my life I can't even begin to unravel it in this post.  Basically the IRS was not a concern, they were just silently taking a chunk of a very small paycheck.  Bills weren't an issue for me, I was living with a friend paying for just the room.

In 2010 I leave Texas for Nebraska, and the IRS follows me.  Things are more expensive here, so having someone else get my money is less acceptable than it was.  I end up getting on the phone with the IRS again and try to explain what I think happened, eventually they tell me that until I take legal action or have my mom take responsibility, they are going to keep taking money.  The last time I talked to my mom was the day I was leaving Texas, she was calling to borrow money.  In between then and now she managed to get sent to prison.

I don't know if the IRS finally figured it out or if my mom did something while she was in prison, but the government mailed me a check for all the wages they had garnished and the lien is marked as paid.  For years I was content with that, but now that I am older and know a little more about the world, I have questions.  This is where I'm hoping to get help from you guys.

How can I have that lien removed from my name?  I feel like it is hurting my credit score.

What are the odds of me seeing any of that money, even though I know it is long well spent (overspent, I'm sure)?

I found a number to the NICB to report insurance fraud, but I wanted to get advice here before I did anything.  

I have a functional relationship with my mom nowadays.  She cleaned up her act and we talk on the phone, I went down to visit once, she says she quit drinking.  I don't want to totally hose her and send her into a downward spiral, but I also want to have a good shot at building my own life without all this IRS red tape in my past.


TL;DR: I think my mom fraudulently took insurance money from me, left me with the taxes, which led to me being garnished and having a lien filed.  I would like to at least have the lien removed, any of the money that can be recovered without putting my mom in a hardship would also be welcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,,,,,,,

I moved into an apartment with two roommates in October of 2016 and gave my roommate (who I was subleasing from) a $500 security deposit.

5b60e5a1da52255c20d0a1f6,"My landlord wants to increase my rent by 30%. There is no lease.. FYI, the landlord is my mother. In September, I agreed to rent one of her properties for $800 per month. No lease was ever presented to me, so there is no signed agreement.

Over the next several months, my mother (a full-blown narcissist) eventually estranges everyone she knows, including my dad, all three of her children, and all three of their spouses, by saying some truly horrible things that she cannot take back (one small example: in a group text, she told everyone in our family that my wife was only with me for the money, and was not stupid enough to ever have children with me, and that she would eventually leave me) (my wife was not amused). She has recently initiated a divorce against my father (amazing man, btw, my top role model in life).

Now, she has sent me a text message saying she wants to increase my rent from $800 to $1050 (31.25%). I have not responded. Actually, we haven't spoken in two or three months.

------------------------

I can easily afford this rent increase, and I do think the proposed rate is fair for the unit. However, I am not feeling particularly inclined to cooperate right now, given she's been fairly horrible to everyone in the family, myself and my wife included.

So, here is my plan. And please let me know if you can see any problems with it.

1) I am going to ignore her request to increase rent. It was sent via text message, is counter to our existing agreement, there is no lease, and to the best of her knowledge I have blocked her texts and calls anyway. I will actually continue to avoid contact entirely.

2) I will continue to mail her rent checks for $800 on a monthly basis. The payment history is already very well established, as I have always paid with checks, which she has been depositing.

3) My wife and I want to move out, quickly. We are currently looking at houses, and are planning on buying within 2-4 months, and already have a number of candidates that fit what we are looking for and are in our price range.

4) We plan on giving my mother 30 days written notice that we are moving out. Once we are out, the unit will be open for either a) renting out to a new tenant, or b) my father moving in. Personally, I'm a very big fan of Option B.

As there is no lease, I feel like I am fairly well protected. I do like to plan for the worst case scenario though, which would entail my mother continuing to go nuclear against her family and possibly trying to evict my wife and I. Chances of that happening are only about 15%, I think, as long as I do not poke the bear by opening my mouth and talking to her. But I think that if she did decide to do that, we would be moved into our new home by the time anything could ever come of it anyway.

I had no idea how to title the post well, because it's all very odd to me. I've been separated from my husband for over 4 years now. I haven't seen or spoken to him in over 3 of those years. I have no idea where he's living, and divorce has been complicated to try and start. This isn't about a divorce though. I just had a child with another man, and I didn't know anything about paternity laws in my state. I live in Oklahoma and found out after delivery that if I'm married my husband is the legally presumed father of my child and my childs actual father cannot be put on the birth certificate or be the legal father. I now know he has to sign a denial of paternity and the biological father has to sign an acceptance. The issue is, I have no way to get my husband to sign the form. To my knowledge, he's still living out of state in California but I have no idea where other than the state. What actions can I take to get him to sign this form? Is there any service that can help? Do I need a lawyer?

Edit: A nurse in the hospital suggested that if I absolutely cannot find him to go and file for child support against him because the agency could find him and he could come and deny paternity.

I've been living in my current building for two years and In the last five months the building has become infested with roaches, there are violent drug addicts that live in the building that have punched holes in the walls and puked all over the hallways, many people don't have working keys to their own apartments and the landlord hasn't done anything despite months of pleading with him. Beyond that, it's a six unit three story row house and 2/3 bedrooms don't have access to the fire escape because the middle windowless room has the second exit boarded up. 

Yesterday my apartment was broken into and what estimates at $4000 worth of my belongings and cash were stolen. My neighbors bike was also stolen. I was at the beach celebrating my birthday and my landlord told me it's my fault I was robbed because I was not home. He was in my kitchen yesterday fixing a problem (after four months of begging him to do it) and he told me he saw my door open even though he knew I wasn't home. I suspect him of course, but I truly don't think he's THAT shady, but I suspect one of the shoddy shady as fuck people he hired to ""fix"" the problems did. The cops busted our door down a month ago and the man he sent to fix the doorframe did it so badly that you have to practically bodyslam the front door to actually lock it.

5b60e5a1da52255c20d0a4c7,"Is my internship illegal?. I live in Florida. At the beginning of the summer I accepted an unpaid web development role at a start up. I was skeptical to begin with, but they said I could set my own hours and it was only part time. I also planned on working another part time job. I was the only unpaid intern they hired (which they said was because unlike everyone else who was local and could continue working throughout the year, I had to return to school at the end of the summer). They stated since I was unpaid the work I would be doing would be different. I decided to go for a few days to see what it was like since there was no real obligation. 


After the first day, the CTO pulled me aside and stated that once we finished the training period I would be paid for my work. Now, I likely would not have stayed if they had not said they intended to paid me. However, the work I have been doing is exactly the same as everybody else, and the one month review where they were planning on converting me to paid that was supposed to happen weeks ago has been continually pushed back. The supervisors are now all at a conference for a week leaving only interns in the office and another week without pay for me. I would feel bad if I left because everything we've been working on has been in partners and I don't want to leave mine in the dust.

I should also note that all interns are technically independent contractors (I don't know if that changes anything).

Within a month, one of the battery cells went out. The dealer fixed it and said the problem was solved. And then it happened again. The dealer fixed it the second time and promised it wouldn't happen again. After the third time, my brother asked to exchange the car or to have someone else fix it because he was tired of being stranded on the freeway. The dealer then blocked his phone number.

When he went to the dealer in person, the receptionist would say the dealer was on lunch, in a meeting, etc.

The dealership has gone out of business so there's no way to return the car. So now, he'd like to junk it, but the title is still in the dealer's name.

5b60e5a1da52255c20d0a7e7,"Tenet going to sue for property damages (x-post from /r/landlord). So this is going to be a long story, but I’ll make sure to add a TL;DR. I’m going to start in the beginning. 
My parents bought a foreclosed house in what-I-though was a very nice, quaint, small Indiana town (however in the past 6 months, my perspective of the town has completely changed). It was a fixer-upper and once it was nice and livable they stayed there for a year, then decided to move back to their primary home and rent out the newly renovated home. First few tenets were all right, paid rent on time and kept a good line of communication with my parents-at least my dad who was the man in charge of getting the rent and writing out receipts. When our old tenets left because the couple were having marital issues, they broke the contract and gave us the keys to the house. No biggie (at this time, my dad did not do a formal lease including a leasing contract-my parents are traditional salt-of-the-earth immigrants from Mexico that attained citizenship in the 90s). 
However, after my dad inspected the home after the couple left, he noticed they left in a bad shape. The neighbor-next-door love my dad and the elderly neighbor told my dad that her son is looking for a place and thought it would be nice to have him next door to her. My dad thought it would be a nice idea and knew the son to be a handy-man (later I would know for this to be complete BS) and trusted the son to fix up any repairs from the last tenet and my dad would lower the rent about 50 dollars. Deal was made, and the son moved in and got started on repairs around the house, such as holes in walls, holes in doors, broken window screen-minimal stuff. 
The first month, we did not pay and took out what he spent on materials and didn’t pay rent. The wife was working at factory in-town and the man was stay-at-home working on things. Months passed and we didn’t get rent, as the wife was fired for starting a fight at work and couldn’t get ends met. We were lenient and told them to pay us as soon as they could. The tenet wanted then a formal lease contract so he could get a lawyer that was in charge of a trust fund to pay the rent due. The trust fund lawyer never got a hold of us, and the following month the tenet was arrested for paraphernalia of crystal meth. The following month, the wife of the tenet was also arrested for the same charges and by the start of this year-my parents were stuck with an abandoned property and rent due. Months past and no communication between the arrested tenets, while I reached out to tenets’ family members to get a response from them as to what to do with their personal belongings. No one was available or disposed to help the tenets. My dad decided to go to court and legally evict them and have a judge figure out what to do with their personal belongings. The initial court hearing ruled that the wife-who was out of jail sooner than the other tenet- were to go to the property and put things into a storage unit, so the house could be cleared out.  
	Also, to give a glimpse of the amount of crap they had I’ll give you a mental image of a Goodwill store vomiting into a second-story home. Nascar posters and a large waterbed decorated the house-things were trash. Nothing of value was found at the house. 
	The wife came and took things to the storage and my dad with his helpers made trips to her storage and fill it up with remaining things they had at the house. Once the storage was full, my dad moved things to a tool shed we have behind the house, but larger things such as furniture was left on the front porch-which we later got cited by the city. Everything was tossed and my dad had a city garbage truck takes loads of things away. 
	A second court hearing was held earlier today, so my dad could get something figured out with the rent that was past due. They came into a payment agreement, however at the hearing the former tenet had a list of two pages of things that were missing and wants to claim property damage. 

My questions are for my dad, do the tenets have a viable case against my dad for a property damage claim? If the property was abandoned and no communication was made with the landlord to remove the items and the storage was full, could the landlord be held responsible with the property hold it as private property? 

The current situation of the rental property stands as everything is cleared out, my dad is working on repairs and hoping to continue to rent the house out or is thinking about having a property management take care of the house. 

**TL;DR** Dad owns a rental property in small-town, USA. Dad leases it to dead-beat son of our next-door-neighbor. Fail to make rent. Tenets get arrested, leave rental property and their personal property abandoned.  Court decides to have them move things to storage unit, things get thrown out because unit gets too full.

5b60e66dda52255c20df37bb,"[TX] Continuing to collect hold support after our mom died?. Since I was 4 and my sister was 3, we had lived with our mother after escaping our abusive father. When we were teenagers, my mom finally got our dad to start paying the child support he owed us (somewhere in the realm of $90,000). And we have received fairly regular payments since then. We even continued to receive payments after we both became adults, and my mom usually gave the money to us to help with our college expenses. My sister and I are 21 and 22 now.

In March of last year my mom died. It was devastating to my sister and I, as she was our only real family in the world. We have never even met our father. My mother left us a lot of paperwork, instructing us what to do after she died. One of the papers explains that we have the right to continue to collect child support after her death (sec. 154.013 in the Texas statutes is what she referenced).

I’ve tried to talk to our local child support office about it, but they were clueless and told me that the Waco Child support office would call us about it. They never did, so we called them but it was just never ending recorded voice prompts. I’ve had to move cities, and transfer schools all while dealing with my moms death, and it’s hard for me to find time to drive to Waco.

I guess my question is, how should I go about collecting this child support? Should I be able to change it with the child support office or will I need an attorney?

5b60e66dda52255c20df3864,"VA, USA - can my friend's (18) parents legally kick her out with no notice and take her car, money and belongings?. I'll start off by saying the friend is 18 and this takes place in Virginia. For the purpose of this story we will call her Friend. 

The story begins in October when friend was working part time to build savings and taking classes online which her mom paid for monthly. She did not pay rent or have any legal lease to live in the home although she has lived with her mom her entire life. 

Short backstory- friend lived with her mom, brother and stepfather basically all her life (stepfather and friend never got along.) mom and stepfather became separated and mom, brother (7) and friend all moved about 1.5 hours away from stepfather. Months later mom decides she wants stepfather to come visit and he agrees but says Friend can't be present. So mom asks Friend if she can stay the weekend at another friend's house. For the purpose of the story we will call her Roommate. 

Long story short, mom and Friend got into a huge fight but in the end Friend agreed to stay at Roommate's for the weekend. While Friend was leaving mom took her debit cards, all the money from her savings, and her most recent paycheck. Mom told friend she would give the money back when she returns home after the weekend. 

The weekend comes and goes and mom still will not allow friend to return home. After about a week she informs friend that she used the money she took from her to pay off friend's car (the car is in mom's name but friend is the primary driver.) friend does not give her permission to do this but she assumes that would mean the car now belongs to friend. Friend chooses not to take action against her mom as she wants to maintain a good relationship because she assumed she would eventually return home. 

Another week goes by and mom tells friend she's going to come by Roommate's house to pick up her car and get the oil and tires changed. Mom picks up the car and informs friend the next day that she sold it and will not be getting her another one. Friend has to call out of work for the next week while she figures out how to buy a car with no credit, no money and no consigner. Friend buys a car with $0 down and a huge interest rate. Mom feels bad and says she will help her pay it off when she returns home. 

Mom promises friend can return in November. November comes and goes. Mom promises friend she can return by thanksgiving. Thanksgiving comes and goes. Mom promises friend she can return by Christmas. Christmas comes and goes. Between Christmas and New Years mom promises friend she can come back soon she just wants friend to learn how to live on her own first.

The next week mom removes friend from all insurance plans, cuts off her phone service, stops paying for her online classes, and begins selling her personal belongings she left at the house when she thought she was only leaving for the weekend. 

At this point it's clear to friend that stepfather has moved in permanently and she's out of the house for good. Keep in mind she's still living rent free with Roommate and Roommate's parents who were also under the impression that she would be only staying there temporarily. So now our question is can she do anything to get her money or belongings back from her mom? Can her mom legally evict her without notice? Does this count has illegal eviction even though 3+ months have passed? Basically at this point she no longer cares about staying on good terms with mom and she just wants her money back so she can move out from Roommate's house on her own.

Based on other posts in this sub it seems like mom can legally evict friend by giving her a notice with enough time to move out. Mom gave friend a few hours notice to leave for the weekend promising she can return. Therefore she didnt give her enough notice to legally evict her but it's now been over 3 months before it was clear that she cannot return home so is it too late to do anything?",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.75,,0.25,,0.25,,,,0.25,,0.25

Firstly im 24, living in Michigan. I was adopted privately when I was 2, after being removed from my birth mother's home for child endangerment. 

Now, my adopted parents and I are estranged. My birth mom is actually deceased, she died in 06' and I have no idea who my birth father is as my parents have denied me access to my adoption file. My birth father also walked away when my birth mom got pregnant. 

I'm wondering if its possible to legally unadopt myself? I identity with my birth name, my birth family  (who I found and am in contact with). I'm currently married so this wouldn't even effect my current last name, only what my legal ""maiden"" name is. Personally I want to be as completely removed from my adopted ""family"" as you can be. My adopted brother basically gives no fucks about his parents and I know for a fact I will be saddled with any sort of care for them, funeral costs etc if something happens. They are not my parents and I want to be untangled with them.

A few months ago I attended training with my supervisor, we are both males and he is significantly older than I. We had originally planned to stay at the same hotel, however different rooms as is policy.

On arrival he did not book his room correctly and turned to me almost expecting me to say he could share mine. I offered that he could use my room to look for another hotel.

He found another hotel and after the first day of training he complained about how my hotel had the better facilities. I offered for him to use the facilities at my hotel and we could go to dinner after he was finished. He went swimming and after he was finished I said he could change in my bathroom and then we could go to dinner. He said he didn't need to change in the bathroom and proceeded to undress and change right in front of me in the bedroom area of the hotel. This obviously made me uncomfortable and I looked away.

I guess my questions are,
1) Should I report this? Or is this just acceptable as its not unlike a locker room situation?
2) Has to much time gone by for me to report this? It just recently came up again in a conversation and obviously it does bother me a bit.
3) If I take this to our HR what potential fallout could harm me?

I never got either of them.

Fast forward to August 2017 and I get a text from my ex-wife with a picture of a collections notice, to her and her alone, with her parents address and my last name.  The car was originally in her name first (mine second), but I had switched it after we separated in early 2015.  

The notice says that I have 30 days to pay or dispute by mail, already 2 weeks into the deadline.  I go to my EZ-Pass account and I see that the date, time, and lane match up with what was claimed to be unpaid.  $4 was taken out to go to Delaware DOT.  I send in the collections paperwork with the EZ-Pass statement, as instructed.  I even circled and highlighted the transaction, to no avail.  They ""never got"" the paperwork and now it is past the time to dispute.  $4 is now $66.50.

5b60e66dda52255c20df3980,"[MN] Recently moved to 35 minutes from my old place, decided to try out a new autoshop near my new apartment and they damaged my engine.. Hello,

I recently moved about 30 minutes to be closer to my office. I noticed that my 2010 Audi A4 had a rough idle and then a check engine light came on. Since my old shop was about an hour away, I decided to simply bring it to the autoshop right behind my apartment building to get the issue diagnosed. I want to note that this shop had almost all positive reviews online and belonged to a company with multiple locations although I dont think it is a national chain or anything.

I dropped the car off overnight, and they called me the next day saying my spark plugs needed to be replaced along with 4 coilpacks. They quoted me a price over double what my old shop would do it for so I told them to simply put everything back together so I could drive it over to that shop when I had time. I will also note that I just had the sparkplugs replaced by the previous shop only 3 months earlier as part of a general tune up, and have not had anything but an oil change done since.

When I get to my main shop, an Audi specific shop thats been in business for quite some time run by someone who is pretty well known in the local car scene, he pulls off the engine cover and the Volkswagen Auto Group electrical connectors leading to the coilpacks are completely damaged. As if whoever was removing them last didnt know the trick to opening VAG connectors.

I ended up needing more than just the recommended service, turns out after smoking the engine I had a failing rear main seal which I had a third shop fix under warranty.

I told my main shop to order new electrical connectors, and they say its going to be about 200 dollars out the door to replace. Im sure I could do it myself for almost nothing but I dont want to be wasting my time working on my car for someone elses mistake especially since its winter and I dont have a garage. Im in the process of writing a letter to their central office but Im not entirely sure what to say. Does anyone know what it takes to file a small claim in MN if they say no?

5b60e66dda52255c20df3998,"Is this agreement legal?? CT. In the fall of 2015 I found myself in a situation where I needed to get a new car. The car that I had been driving needed so much work done to it, that for me it wasn’t worth fixing. At the time I was also taking care of medical bills that had piled up while I was out of work the previous year, and my credit wasn’t in the place it is now, so I couldn’t get approved for a loan myself. My girlfriend at the time offered to take a car loan out in her name that I would make the payments on. At the time there was no signed agreement between her and I made regarding me making the payments, and my name wasn’t on the car loan whatsoever. I was only an insured driver on her policy, something she did to make her own insurance less expensive, while also making it easier on me. I drove the car and made the payments on time every month for a year, until September of 2016.


Long story short, she was unhappy in the relationship and suggested I move out, which lead to us ultimately breaking up very shortly after I moved out. Of course, this resulted in me returning the car to her. She decided to sell the car at a loss very quickly so she didn’t have to deal with it, while making me feel as though I had to reimburse her for the money she lost on the sale. She drafted up an agreement at the time, saying the amount that I owed her, with a payment plan. Having been completely blindsided by her request to me move out, I wasn’t in a clear headspace and very depressed. I was out of the apartment that I had lived in for two years, she kept both of our cats that we had (one of which was MY LIFE), and I had no car.


For reasons I can’t explain now, I felt obligated to agree to and sign her agreement. I have begrudgingly sent her a check for $200 every month for the past 14 months, all the while thinking the agreement that we have is unfair. I’ve done some research on signed agreements, and feel as though hers has holes in it, but am not sure. The agreement doesn’t detail what the money is for. The agreement provides an address that I am to send the payment to, but that has changed since the agreement began. (One of the bullet points on the agreement state “Any modifications to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.”) I don’t feel like I’m legally obligated to pay her back for a car she sold that didn’t have my name anywhere on it, especially since there was no signed agreement in the beginning, when I originally got the car.

I work in an office with one other co-worker. He is male and we have the same position but I am the senior of the two.

I requested a transfer to work in another state to live with my fiance. I worked on detail in the other state who is aware of my interest in transferring and would like to have me. Unfortunately, they can't hire right now. 

After this request my supervisor, who is not the authority to determine if the transfer is approved, began treating me much worse. I get that being a jerk is not illegal but I have documented several incidences where my male co-worker was clearly favored. 

I then was up for a promotion, which was at the discretion of my supervisor, and which I didn’t get. She said she decided I needed to obtain a job certification first which she hadn’t told me prior. Additionally, part of my supervisor’s job is to help support me in getting certified. 

I made an informal complaint to her supervisor about what was going on and the treatment I’d been getting compared to my male peer. He thought she was being fair. 

Since this complaint my supervisor has been even worse. Lack of communication, discussing my work with my co-worker and not me, and preventing me from working towards my certification. Other senior staff are aware of this and no one is trying to help me. She has a history of bullying her staff. 

So I need the certification to get the promotion, as well as for my job, and I’ve been told to stop working towards requirements for the certification. I think this is considered retaliation and there is a financial loss from this. 

Side note: She is still supporting my co-worker in progress towards his certification.

Also, I was told that my informal complaint didn’t impact any decision on approving a transfer. It’s basically political.

There’s a lot of other examples I have documented of unfair treatment but I don’t want to make this post too long. 

Ultimately, I have great job security. I like my job and I don’t want to let one supervisor stop me from pursuing what I need to do to advance my career. I also don’t want to jeopardize my chances of working with the other state or anyone to think this is just complaining because I want t to transfer.

Any advice on what to do here? Pursue discrimination case or retaliation case? I was thinking about filing an informal grievance and going from there.

5b60e66dda52255c20df3abd,"(IL - US) 5 year old domestic battery warrant that i never knew about, cops want me to turn myself in, accuser is deceased.. Hi, I'm new to legal advice and being in trouble in general, so please let me know if I'm missing anything.

First things first, I'm going to turn myself in obviously, I'm going to have my lawyer set up a time to do that.

About 5 years ago, my drug addict father showed up at my mom's house, after I hadn't seen him for over a year. In my opinion, he was messed up on prescription painkillers when he arrived. He was parked in the driveway, I yelled at him to leave, we yelled at each other. He tried to open the car door and I closed it back on him. I ran inside, called my mom, and he backed out of the driveway, called the cops and said I was threatening him. We were the only two people present.
Honesty, I have no idea what I said to him. I was 20 at the time, and pretty upset that my abusive father showed up at my house without warning.
The police arrived, assessed the situation, and told me something about how in domestic cases they usually arrest someone no matter what, but that my father wasn't going to sign a complaint and they told him to not come back to the property. The next day, apparently he called the police to sign a complaint. A warrant was issued for my arrest at the time, for misdemeanor domestic abuse

Here's where it gets fucked.
I was never notified I had a warrant. Nobody ever showed up at my house. I never got a letter in the mail. I've had my ID ran by multiple police departments, including the one wanting to arrest me now (never in trouble or any other charges ever, just verbal warnings), applied for jobs, school, new passport, left the country and went through customs, etc ect. Nothing ever came up, so I had no idea.

About a year after that, my father passed away because his liver failed, due to the ridiculous amount of prescription pills and alcohol he was consuming.

Cut to just now. The police called me, saying they were going through old warrants and needed me to turn myself in. They explained that they tried to have the state's attorney quash the warrant, but the attorney refused. I'm not walking into the police station without a lawyer obviously. 

What the hell happens next? The cops are saying that they'll transport me to court, I get booked, and then the bond court will PROBABLY throw it out. I don't believe them at all. I have bail/bond money, but I'm just afraid as fuck of jail.",,0.25,,,0.75,,,,0.25,0.75,,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,0.25

5b60e66dda52255c20df3ba4,"Landlord has lied, worried about future confrontations. Hello a bit of background information.

Me and my girlfriend are tenants at an apartment complex in Kansas. We have two cats and a dog and fully comply with their two pet limitations. We originally moved in with both of out own cats, but after my girlfriend moved several states over. I convinced her to see a therapist and her therapist suggested a therapy animal. She decided she wanted a puppy as she believed it would encourage her to go out more to combat her depression and anxiety. I have my cat, and she has her dog who is registered as an ESA and her cat. She has the documentation and everything for her ESA and is still seeing her therapist.

Two months ago we received note for an inspection regarding maintenance for fire alarms and the heater in our apartment. Upon inspection the landlord discovered our ESA dog and expressed concerns on how dirty our carpets we're and informed us that we need to find a carpet cleaner and provide a receipt and provide official documentation that our dog was an ESA. I understood and agreed that we were in the wrong because the lease we signed stated we must inform the landlord of any new pets in the apartment. The least we could do is clean the apartment. She stated she would follow up with a inspection two weeks later to see if we cleaned our carpets.

Two weeks goes by and we we're in our apartment all day and the landlord never arrived to inspect our unit. Concerned I made a call to the landlord who blantantly lied to me claiming that she sent someone to inspect our unit and claimed we never hired a cleaner. I obviously denied that happened and I had a receipt emailed to me from the carpet cleaner as proof.

My concern moving forward is what I can do, as we are receiving another inspection in the upcoming week with no reason behind why we are having our unit inspected. I feel as though our landlord is trying to encourage us to terminate our lease since they have no grounds to evict us. My biggest concern is that this time the landlord will lie or make up excuses and we will have no way to prove she is lying since neither of us will be present in the apartment all day.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,,,,0.75,0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,0.25

5b60e66dda52255c20df3b67,"(FL) Roommates and I cannot come to an agreement over how the rent will be split up, and one is threatening to move out and stop paying rent.. Throwaway here.

About five months ago, we moved into a house that has five bedrooms with one bigger master bedroom/bath, and four other roughly equally sized rooms. Five people moved into this house initially, with myself and my SO living in the master bedroom. 

After we signed the lease (with only four of us on it, myself, SO, and two others) we tried to come to an agreement on who would pay what on how the rent was divided, all done through a group message. Because the top two incomes on the lease weren't enough, we needed a cosigner on the lease, which my family member stepped in to be. What we eventually decided on, was that SO and I would pay 460 for the master, and each upstairs bedroom would be 410. I would also subsidize the cost of the upstairs bedroom that was going unoccupied by paying an additional 410 a month, with the explicitly defined understanding that if we ever filled that fifth bedroom with a sixth person, that person would be paying the 410 instead and no one that is staying in an upstairs bedroom for 410 has their rent changed at all.

Everyone in the group message, in writing, agreed to this. I have screenshots. 

Now we've picked up a sixth roommate, and the roommates have begun talking about renegotiating the spread of the rent. I brought up the screenshotted conversation and agreement we made months earlier that everyone agreed to, and two of the roommates said that this was now ""unfair"" and we should renegotiate. The other roommate flat out rejected all of our negotiations for various reasons, and ultimately said if we couldn't come to an agreeable resolution, he would be moving out at the end of the month. In writing, I asked if he was going to move his stuff out, stop residing at the residence, and stop paying rent, even though his name was the one on the lease, and he said yes, so now I have written confirmation.

The other roommates are also unhappy with the fact that we want to stick with the original agreement we all agreed to, but they have not threatened to move out.

If he does end up moving out, I'm afraid the cosigner and I will be held responsible for paying for this guy's rent while he gets off scot free to live wherever else he chooses. If we don't pay it, then we get evicted within 3 days of the rent being due. 

Currently looking, but there so far don't seem to be any prospects that are taking over his room.

What options do I have? Am I shit out of luck? If he moves out, violating the terms of the lease, can I pay his portion for the rest of the lease and go after him for it in small claims? I legitimately don't know, and it doesn't look like a compromise will be reached any time soon. Any help would be appreciated.",0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.75,,,0.25,,0.25
5b60e66dda52255c20df3c1c,"PA, USA - Can an employer force you to sign an agreement to deduct wages?. Hello. The company I work for requires a yearly hands-on competency test. This year, they have mandated that if you miss your testing time, and don’t give 24 hour notice, you will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction. Obviously, it is illegal for an employer to deduct wages without approval; however, my employer seems to think they’ve found a way around that. There is an online test that you must take beforehand, in which 100% is required. The very first question is along the lines of, “I agree that if I miss my hands-on test, I will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction”. To me, this sounds as though they are forcing you to agree to a payroll deduction in order for you to stay employed. Is this legal? If not, any advice on how to approach management with my concern?

5b60e66dda52255c20df3c31,"Insurance claim in CO - Roofer trying to squeeze me?. We had a nasty hail storm come through in May 2016, I made a claim for a full roof replacement and non-roof related repairs such as deck, broken window, fencing, etc.

I went through the claim and broke out the roof-related repairs costs line-by-line to come up with the total cost for the job, since the roofing company would NOT be performing any non-roof related repairs. This is what we agreed on for the cost, and what is reflected in the proposal from the roofer, not including supplements. I even sent them a copy of the claim so they could see for themselves. So, Cost – $500 deductible credit + supplements.

Nearly 6 months later, the roofing company tells me the amount they've successfully negotiated for the supplements, and I receive an additional check from the insurance company to cover them.

The roofing company invoiced me for remaining balance, exactly what was in the proposal, base negotiated cost + supplements (which we now had a figure for). I paid it promptly and in full.

I must have been wrong in thinking that the transaction was over, because the roofing company came back AGAIN and says that ""After auditing the final amount we saw that contractor O&amp;P was not included in the first final invoice we sent. For that I do apologize on that."" and ""as soon as it was discovered we made sure to send it out. This has never happened on any of my jobs and again I do apologize for this oversight.""

First of all, it seems wrong to me that they can come back AFTER the invoice has been paid and ask for more money. If I buy a donut and walk out, you can't chase me down the street and say you messed up and undercharged me. However, I'm not trying to wriggle through get anything for free.

Secondly, the proposal mentions nothing of an additional cost TBD later in addition to base cost + supplements. I called my adjuster and he said that the supplements (that had already been paid) included overhead &amp; profit, and in fact makes up the bulk of the supplement amount.

Thirdly, the insurance company is failing to show me the math of HOW they arrived at this NEW total, and instead is only threatening to put a lien on my house. They say that I MUST give them ALL money that I've received from the insurance company or else they will be in violation of the law for helping me benefit from a claim. Surely they understand that they are not entitled to any money for repairs they did not make, but the bigger question is even IF I received more money for the roof than what we had agreed upon, why would they be entitled to that money? We agreed on a price, and that's what I've paid. If there IS extra money, shouldn't it go back to the insurance company if anything?

I'm trying to get my adjuster to answer one simple question: of the money I've received, how much of it is for roof-related repairs? My policy covers depreciation for the dwelling, but not the detached garage, so looking at these numbers for Replacement Cost, Actual Cash Value, Depreciation.. it's all a bit overwhelming and confusing. It's been difficult getting a straight answer from my adjuster since he's still slammed and is hard to get ahold of. After looking at the claim again, I/we used the Actual Cash Value of the roof-related items to come up with the original cost, now that I have more understanding of how this works, should we have used the Replacement Cost? If so, the cost WOULD be higher, but as I mentioned, I sent them the claim, they looked it over, and we agreed on the price.

This is the first time I've made a claim of this nature and this process has been different than any auto claim I've made. Is there Colorado law that states I must hand over any money I receive regardless of what was agreed upon? If so, why even bother with a proposal? Or are they trying to take advantage of me?

Driving too closely (minor fender bender in early 2014) in VA

Red light ticket a few months ago in Illinois

5b60e66dda52255c20df3df3,"(PA, USA) Hospital refusing medicine to me after saying that they are unable to help me.. Hello all, I went to the ER yesterday at 1am for severe stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea and vomiting. I was given a slew of IV’s that were supposed to ease some of the pain and nausea. I can’t quite remember the nausea medicine but I was given ranitidine for stomach pain. Within the first few minutes I finally felt better and was able to finally sit up without feeling like me stomach was gonna burst.

Fast forward maybe an hour and the stomach pain returns, It starts to creep until It is a full blown torrent of pain. I begged for some more medicine and after another ranitidine bag I felt a bit better. 

They took blood samples and found that I had a lipase of around 140, this led them to believe it was my pancreas and they gave me a CT dye mix to cat scan my organs. After the cat scan which showed a severely inflamed pancreas, I started itching, BAD. I have had hives before so I told the nurse hives were starting to form and she said, simply “No those bumps are from you scratching.” 10 minutes later and I’m covered head to toe in large, red itchy blotches. It takes them maybe an hours and a half to file some paperwork before they finally give me something to rid of the hives that had me ripping at the bed sheets in pain.

Once my hives cleared, I was given even more drugs, though my abdomen still hurt very bad. I passed out from all the drugs and pain and fell asleep. I was admitted into the hospital overnight and woke up 10am today. Cue, me waking up and vomiting blood-filled green vomit into multiple emesis bags. I begged the nurse and the doctor both for more nausea and pain meds though all I was given was some more ranitidine which at this point does nothing for me.

Now I’m sitting here with the worst pain of my life and the doctors saying I have to deal with it. They recommended I had a endoscopic tube inserted to my stomach to search for ulcers. The only problem is, I’m 17 and this hospital refuses to touch minors with that and I have to instead wait until Monday. (In two days) and see my family physician and get a recommendation before I can go to a different hospital and receive treatment. I asked if I was going to be getting any medicine to last me until then but I was denied everything and I know the pain is gonna return again. I’m just dreading when they take this IV out of me and discharge me. I can’t stand the pain, it hurts too bad. All I want are some pain meds. I guess I’m just gonna have to deal with it though. 

A little side note I would like to add is they took a toxicology test on me and found THC then they tried to say that it was the THC causing my intense pain and inflammation. FML.

TL;DR: I had severe pain and sulfur burps, went to the hospital. They said I had a swollen pancreas then poisoned me (unintentionally) and covered my body with hives before taking an hour and a half to fix it. Currently about to discharge me after not fixing any of my abdominal issues or even giving me some pain meds to make the situation easier.",,0.25,,,0.25,,,,0.25,0.25,,0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,,,0.25,,0.25

My father passed away about 5 months ago after suffering a heart attack during surgery to remove colon cancer.

There are a few odd things that happened, however. I've been trying to ignore them, but they've really been bothering me lately.

1) We had all spoken to my father (who was brain dead at the time) and a few of us were in and out of the room. I stayed in the room the whole time, as I didn't want him to be alone. A few of my family members had come back into the room, and as I was sitting there holding his hand, they pulled the plug. It surprised me, as there was no explicit ""Are you ready to pull the plug?"" They just pulled it, and all of a sudden it got quiet. At the time, I figured maybe it just wasn't like the movies and that's how they did it. But now, I'm second-guessing myself.

2) Apparently, I'm the only one in my family who understood that, when we were finally getting to see him after he had stabilized a bit, we were going to say goodbye. The rest of my family understood that we were just going in to tell him to fight through and that we were here for him. So while the plug pulling surprised me, it REALLY surprised them. 

3) This could totally be an ICU nurse trying to make my mom feel  better, but the ICU nurse said that while my mom was telling him to fight, he raised his arms and pretended to box. I highly doubt that if he was brain dead, he would've been able to do that. 

My dad had leukemia for 10 years and cost his insurance a lot of damn money over the years. I hate to suggest that they were eager to get rid of him, but... I can't help but think that.

Is any of this normal? Is there something odd to this whole scenario?

Supposedly, according to his ex-wife he has already lost custody of his daughter, but the court hasn't decided what will happen to their son.

The problem is we don't know who's telling the truth. Joe says the court didn't take his daughter away, that it's a pending investigation, and his daughter was coached to say the things she did. According to his ex-wife she's worried that he'll molest their son too, but because he isn't  a named victim at this time the court might not take away parental visits.

5b60e66dda52255c20df3f17,"Worried about collecting unemployment/eligibility.. I posted last week about being laid off due to suggesting that I wouldn't be returning after maternity leave. The gist was that my work provides childcare at a cost, the cost is daily, not as needed. This drops my income down to minimum wage and if I am out sick or take a vacation, it's below minimum wage. I simply can not afford their childcare at my wage. I expressed these financial concerns to my boss and less than a week later, I was given a date that my employment would change form full time (40 hours) to ""on call."" I was told by commenters that they were within their rights to lay me off and due to the size of the company, they don't have to comply with FMLA and PDA.

**Current issue**: Since I've been told that I will be laid off at the end of the month, the work place has been... difficult. I received a formal write-up for a small mistake in which my boss stated that she never writes people up but she *has* to write me up. I've been ""spoken to"" twice regarding my behavior while working before today. Today alone, I was spoken to regarding multiple issues ""I created."" The environment has officially gone from stressful to toxic. 

Our workload has been light all week and the boss has been sending people home. I offered to go home today *if* she was cutting again. According to her, it was beyond my authority to request this. Despite my lack of authority, she decided I *could* go home and she approached me to ask if I wanted my full lunch break, a short lunch break or no lunch break. I decided on no lunch break but said ""I need to pop into my room to grab a snack to eat."" She took this as ""I need to go somewhere to get a snack, I'll take a short lunch."" We were obviously on two different pages but did not realize. The person who was sent to break me was incredibly irritated when I was confused, my boss ran into the room I was in while I was dealing with a child and yelled at me ""Do I just need to lay you off today?"" I said no, I just want to do my job. She took me outside to continue to lecture me about how I keep calling shots that aren't mine to call. I told her that I just want to do my job and I try to be easy to deal with and I'm sorry she feels this way, I'll try to stop.

I'm just so lost and confused because I work hard, I show up on time and there is so clearly a personality issue between me and the boss and I can't figure out why I am being targeted for doing the same thing everyone else does. I say yes to every task they ask of me and every time there's been an issue, it's because I'm asking for clarification or support and that's the wrong thing to do. I'm not even comfortable requesting support to go use the restroom and I'm pregnant and have to go frequently. I almost feel crazy at this point.

Ok, work vomit over. I want to quit now. I have evidence that I am going from a full time employee to an on-call employee with no shifts for the first two weeks of feb. My husband claims I can file due to constructive dismissal. After today, I don't want to go back (even after saying I would while my boss was yelling at me). I'm already worried the constructive dismissal would not be enough to be eligible, especially when I *do* have shifts on the book. I want to be able to decline those shifts and still collect due to the environment. I am also concerned these new complaints against my alleged behavioral issues will mean I'm not eligible. If I quit and present my case, is this enough? Should I continue to work for the next 2 weeks? Thanks

I’ve had this phone number for nearly 2 years now. And when I first got the phone number i would receive unwanted calls but that’s normal. I Would inform them this is no longer “so and so’s” phone number and then would block them. Over the course of time I’ve learned the previous phone number holders name and nicknames but that’s about it. Since the beginning of December I’ve been getting calls from this woman who would call looking for “so and so” and i would tell her “this isn’t ‘so and so’s’ number anymore and then would block it.” But she managed to keep getting new phone numbers and continuing to call. It turned into this degrading competition to her to see how many nasty things she could call me. I told her the whole story. How i have had the phone number for a while and that that’s how i knew who the previous owner was but that i didn’t know him in real life and she wouldn’t believe me. She would call and say awful things. Calling me a “scary ass bitch.” “That I’m just a little side hoe” that i was nothing but a “little piece of ass” for this man. So i put her phone number into Facebook and sure enough i found her and where she lives and all about her. Mind you any time she would call from a new number i would continue to block it. Then she decided to start calling from No Caller ID which i couldn’t block. I would get 40 phone calls in 5 minutes from this woman. Continuing to leave voicemails and call me horrible things. Now she’s threatening to show up to the previous phone number owners home and “beat the fuck out of me” i told her I’m filing a police report. But I’m not sure how to go about that. I’ve never had to do this before. I seriously want her to learn a lesson. She’s nearly 40 years old. It’s not like she’s a 16 year old little girl who’s got her britches up her butt.

5b60e66dda52255c20df4012,"My husband's employer is not witholding state taxes for the state we reside in [Mississippi]. This is a lenghty read ... Spoiler, no TL;DR at the end 
:(

Some context - the company that my husband works for is based in Ohio. They have offices in many different states as well as Canada. So my husband and I moved to Mississippi from Oklahoma in October due to this employer relocating him. He has worked for this same company since March of 2017. We both work in Tennessee, but we live in Mississippi. We have switched our licenses, car tags, we have a lease on our rental house, etc. We are permanent, legal residents of Mississippi, and no longer have any legal ties in Oklahoma.

So, the company - until November - was still taking out Oklahoma state witholding on the income tax on his paychecks. He called and asked them to change it to Mississippi- which I thought fixed it. No. From then until present they are taking out Tennessee State taxes. ??? We don't live in Tennessee so we will not file Tennessee State taxes - and Tennessee does not have state tax anyway.

Other than that, Mississippi has the stupid Employees Witholding Exemption Certificate that works as the state's W-4 (at least that's how my employer explained it). I had to fill one out for my job, and I told him to submit one for his when we first moved here. They refused it and said it is useless to them because they do not have an office in Mississippi.

So I did the only thing I could think of and submitted a new W-4 for his company where he withholds more on federal so we can make up the difference when tax time next year rolls around. However, when he submitted it, we noticed his paychecks are different but still more than they should be with the extra taxes taken out. They still are not taking out the extra witholding! He sent in an actual signed form that had our witholding amount on it, and the one they're showing on file is an electronically filled out one with no extra witholding form and it is e-signed. They also had him listed as a D.D.S. (yes, Doctor of Dental Surgery) on his paychecks. I can guarantee if he was a DDS, he wouldn't be working for this bass ackwards company!!

I'm beyond frustrated. I just don't know if I have any ground to stand on with getting an attorney/lawyer. If I do I'm more than willing to hire one. I know that this won't affect our taxes that we are about to file much, if at all, it's next year's that I'm worried about.

5b60e66dda52255c20df4071,"Evicting a roommate for ""nuisance"". Hi folks,

I live in a 3-person apartment in California. All three of us are on the lease. I suspect one roommate might be encouraging the landlord to evict the other two of us. I don't believe our small city has any specific rental laws re; eviction, so we're just bound by state law. The roommate's complaints:

* My other roommate occasionally plays music too loud in his room, though not late a night.
* We mop, but don't mop frequently enough.
* We scrub the counters and sinks, but not frequently enough.
* We, infrequently, leave a pan or two in the sink overnight (once every two weeks or so).
* Sometimes, small messes (e.g. a bit of flour powder from cooking) are left scattered too long on the sink top. This usually gets cleaned up quickly (e.g. soon after cooking) but every month or so, we might
* The smell of the foods we cook bother him, though we run the fan and open the window.
* I once restarted a what I thought was a malfunctioning router while he was gaming (I didn't know he was home).
* I make too much noise walking in the apartment (creaky floorboards and I usually stay up until 1:30, though I try my best to slink and wear slippers).
* We don't shut the lights off every time we leave the room. We do when we intend to permanently leave, but not always if we're going to other rooms to retrieve something or take a call.

Otherwise, we pay our rent, treat the apartment well (the landlord frequently comments how amazing it looks), keep things always sanitary, and don't engage in illegal activities. Does my roommate have a case that the other roommate and I are a ""nuisance"" and thus could be evicted for cause?

**Context for what set my roommate off**

My upset roommate frequently sends out long and vaguely threatening rants to me and my other roommate (""There's scum on the sink behind the faucet. Here's a picture. Clean this up. I will not ask you again"" ""You left your cutting board on the counter and I wanted to use the counter. Move it immediately"" ""You left the dishwasher door open too much. I had to close it.""). I have many emails and text messages containing these rants. 

While I was away on vacation, he sent me some pictures of a extremely minor mess (flour spill + oil spatter; 10 sec clean up time), which I didn't make, and told me to clean it up. I finally lost my temper and to him to knock it off and not bother me on vacation and that the kitchen was perfectly usable in the state it was in. He ranted over text message for a while and then told me that I'm welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. I told him he's welcome to move out if I don't follow his rules. He told me that he was the original tenant in the apartment and kindly allowed me to move in and live with him and therefore am morally bound to follow his rules.

** My commentary**

I agree that, given the standards of cleanliness my roommate demands, the other roommate and I are a nuisance ***for him***. However, I argue that his standards of cleanliness are unreasonable and that my other roommate and I are already meeting him much more than half way. Frankly, I think he has serious control issues and possibly has some form of mental disorder (e.g. no eye contact, shuffling walk, no furniture in his room, never laughs or smiles, never accepts invitations to socialize, etc...).

He does have a point that my other roommate and I are messier than him. However, that's because he doesn't actually use the apartment. He comes out of his cave in once in a blue moon and has a fit when he sees that everything isn't spotless at the moment (i.e. he doesn't consider how long a mess has been there). He doesn't cook or use the kitchen or use the living area. His complaints seem to be primarily about minor aesthetic issues that eventually do get cleaned up regardless or things that he could solve on his own without any difficulty (e.g. he can spend 3 seconds moving a cutting board someone forgot, in a rare instance, to put away if he wants to use the counter). We all have our own bathrooms, so thankfully that's not an issue.

We also know that he allowed the apartment to be illegally sublet at a profit prior to our move-in, but we don't have any evidence beyond the word of the guy who sublet the apartment (and maybe he has some paper-work, but he probably doesn't want to get involved).

We also know that he had previous conflicts with one or two of the previous tenants.

I asked him to compromise and understand that living with roommates always comes with minor annoyances but he told me something like, ""It's unfair that you would expect me to do extra work for anything I didn't cause."" In the context of this conversation, it was regarding the fact I forgot to close the dishwasher door after unloading and he had to close it as he walked by.

** My question **

* Does he have any legal basis to get my other roommate and I evicted?
* Now that he's officially complained to my landlord, what options do my other roommate and I have to present our case and make sure the landlord doesn't see us as bad guys? Both of us intend to move out when the lease terminates, regardless, but I'd prefer to not have to deal with any ensuing landlord issues.",,,,,,,,,,,,0.25,0.75,,,,,,,

My parents chose to foster them, and they lived with us for 4 months. However, we had to let them go back into the system, as they were in danger from their mother. DSS wouldn't supervise visits, she would show up announced, high or drunk, stole from us, among many other things. We made the hard choice to let them go into the foster system to try and protect them from their mother. Out of spite, their mother refused to allow visitation or any contact between us and the children. However, since then, the mother has lost any and all parental rights. I want to know if there's any way I, as a family member and former caregiver, could gain rights for visitation. I want to maintain a relationship with them, so that hopefully, once I have the means, I could adopt them and get them out of the system. I have no contact with their mother or their biological grandparents.

5b60e66dda52255c20df416a,"Cigna denied my FMLA paperwork because of a small error. Today I found out Cigna denied part of my FMLA paperwork for a small error on the form that my doctor made. 

The doctor failed to include two days I have missed from work in his date range for my intermittent leave for Migraine. 

When I spoke with Cigna about this they stated that I can get a second chance, but only because I live in Washington State. Washington State has its own FMLA law. If I lived in a state without secondary protection, Cigna states that they would not reconsider if my doctor corrects the form. 

Cigna never called me to inform me of the error on the form, and just denied my claim. 

When I brought this up, they told me that they aren’t allowed to call. They also said that the law as written allows them to deny a claim and not reconsider it. 

When I asked them where in the law it says they can do this, they mentioned that sections 825.306 and 825.307 of the 1993 FMLA pertain. She stated that it reads that the employer cannot call the doctor to question items on the form. 

This section was obviously intended to protect the employee from the employer unscrupulously contacting doctors trying to prevent the leave from being approved under the law, Cigna is trying to make it about them. 

I want to get this information out there. People living in states without secondary approval could lose their jobs because of stuff like this. People in desperate situations and in poor health could lose their jobs and their ability to pay for their insurance and their ability to receive care because of this policy by Cigna.

Is that even legal? Is there something my girlfriend can do before she is forced to drop from 40 hours to 30-32 a week? Losing 1/4 of your income is pretty harsh so Im hoping that there is a way she can defend herself from losing that money.

Some minor details: This manager just replaced the previous manager who was fired for raking up more HR charges than Weinstein. 

She is new and was hired from an entirely different industry. There was an interim manager that worked in this company for 18 years and surpassed all previous metrics from the previous manager before being replaced by someone who never worked for this entire industry before! 

This new manager wants these employees to go on vacation because this company doesnt take vacation out of the payroll budget that is involved with the managers bonus.

First time here, so sorry if this is already answered. Please provide link to answer if so and I will delete this post. 

**SITUATION**: Other night I tapped the bumper of a man (driver), and his pregnant wife and child (passengers). Speed at impact was no faster than walking speed. There was no damage to my bumper and a slight scuff on theirs, we exchanged insurance and contact info, and I asked to pay out of pocket if he was willing. Next day they contact me and say that they are sore and taking the wife to the dr., and that the impact dislodged the plastic wheel well in their car. However, they are still willing to let me pay out of pocket for car repairs and health insurance co-pay from the dr visit. They gave me a reasonable quote that I accepted. I don't really care if they are faking and just keeping the money, this is an inconvenience for them, and I was at fault. Additionally, the quote would be cheaper than my insurance increase in the long run.  

**QUESTION**: My concern is that I will pay them, but they will still try and make a claim in the future due to injury they didn't know they had yet (or something along those lines). If I have them sign a release of liability contract in front of a notary at the time of payment, will that protect me here in Oregon? If so, is there a recommended release of liability contract template I can download for free? Or am I out of my league here? I think getting a lawyer involved would contradict any future insurance premium savings I would gain from the other party not making a claim.

Male

30 years old

So in 2015 I was diagnosed with a severe migraine variant that involves daily episodes of head pain and neurological deficit.  No fun.  This involved a great deal of emergent investigation and consultation with several specialists.  The problem isn't life threatening but it does carry some risk-factors and it's recommended that I keep a close eye on it.

Fast forward a couple years and I move to a new town.  Migraines aren't doing so hot so I set up a new patient appointment with my current provider (a Physician's Assistant).  I bring in detailed documentation of my case and we discuss my problem at length.  I watch her (presumably) enter all of this information into her computer.  At the time she seemed pretty on top of things, referred me to a new neurologist, got some bloodwork set up.  I felt like I was in good hands.

Fast forward to the present day and things are not going very well.  I am having severe issues with my neck and the neurological component of my migraines has become frighteningly pronounced.  My neurologist is booked for the month so last week I report to her office to discuss what's happening.  We decide to order a set of MRIs.  A number of things about the visit strike me as very odd/unprofessional/concerning:

- ""Wait what neurological symptoms?""  She forgot about them.  This was essentially the entire focus of my first visit.  I had given her a printed out description of exactly how my migraine auras present and we had discussed at length how important it is to monitor these because they can mimic some very dangerous things.  She kept this printout.  I checked my records after the visit and it seems none of those things had ever been recorded.

- She insisted the weakness/numbness on the right side of my body was due to a pinched nerve in my neck.  This is despite three different neurologists previously diagnosing these symptoms as brain-related, either migrainous or epileptic in nature.  I explained this to her, which she completely disregarded when placing the MRI order explained below.

- She forgot I have blood pressure issues.

- She prescribed me a muscle relaxer which the pharmacist later told me interacts with one of my other medications.

- She said she wanted a good look at the soft tissues in my neck, but ordered a spinal MRI.  I thought this sounded wrong so I checked with the imaging center when scheduling my appointment.  Wrong indeed.  I had to call her and have the order revised.

- Upon arrival at the imaging center, a confused looking receptionist told me my provider had called at the last minute and changed the order again.  I was never contacted about this.

- When ordering an MRI, the doctor/PA notes the patient's current problem so the radiologist knows what to look for.  For my Brain MRI, the order reads ""Migraine without Aura"".  I've been diagnosed with Migraine *with* Aura for 2 years.  This was established at my first appointment.  It's rather important, because frequent migraine auras can actually leave behind lesions detectable on MRIs.  No mention of the extremely complicated, localized neurological deficits I have such a detailed history of.

- Likewise, my Neck MRI order fails to mention the severe pain I've been having in the front left side of my neck, which was presumably the entire reason we were getting it done.  Instead it only mentions the numbness/weakness in my arm which (again) already has an established brain origin.

I got the MRI on Tuesday.  The imaging center said it would take up to 48 hours for the scans to be read, and then my doctor would call me to let me know what's next.  Friday rolls around and I still haven't heard anything, so I drive over to the imaging center and pick up the reports myself.  They tell me the reports were finished on *Wednesday morning* and I must have missed the call from my doctor.  I triple checked.  I'm signed up to receive multiple forms of contact.  No emails or portal messages or anything.  There are even some abnormalities noted on the report, which I thought typically meant the patient was contacted as soon as the information had become available.

Funny thing about the MRI report, it came back noting I had ""right sided neck pain"".  My pain is on the left.  I don't know who's fault that is.  It's like they're throwing darts at a board.

So now I have these reports that I have to second-guess because my provider gave the radiologist shoddy/incomplete information about my case.  I'm taking drugs that interact with each other because it's the only solution I've been offered.  The diagnosis I spent over $10,000 resolving in 2015 is now being changed by someone who isn't even technically a doctor.

I know I haven't been physically injured by anyone, but does any of this sound like malpractice?  I don't even like the idea of suing anyone, but this illness has caused me a great deal of disability and I am now looking at a situation where I may have wasted almost two thousand dollars on scans that need to be re-done because somebody else didn't do their job.  Sorry for the length of this post I'm just very wound up about the whole thing and have no idea how much of this I should consider acceptable or how I should proceed with handling it.
